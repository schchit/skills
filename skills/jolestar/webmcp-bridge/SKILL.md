# WebMCP Bridge

Use this skill to operate `@webmcp-bridge/local-mcp` through `uxc` shortcut commands.

If the target site does not expose native WebMCP and does not already have a fallback adapter, switch to `$webmcp-adapter-creator`.

## Prerequisites

- `uxc` is installed and available in `PATH`.
- `npx` is installed and available in `PATH`.
- Network access is available for the target website.
- On a fresh machine, or under an isolated `HOME`, install Playwright browsers first with `npx playwright install`.
- For local repo development, you may replace the default `npx -y @webmcp-bridge/local-mcp` launcher with `WEBMCP_LOCAL_MCP_COMMAND='node packages/local-mcp/dist/cli.js'`.

## Core Workflow

1. Identify the bridge source mode before creating any link:
   - Native or polyfill target: use `--url <url>`.
   - Built-in adapter preset: use `--site <site>`.
   - Third-party adapter module: use `--adapter-module <specifier>` and optionally `--url <url>`.
2. Pick one stable site name and one site-scoped profile path:
   - default profile root: `~/.uxc/webmcp-profile/<site>`
   - never share one profile across different sites
3. Create or refresh the fixed link pair for that site:
   - `command -v <site>-webmcp-cli`
   - `command -v <site>-webmcp-ui`
   - if either is missing or the source config changed, run `skills/webmcp-bridge/scripts/ensure-links.sh`
4. Use the CLI link for normal automation:
   - `<site>-webmcp-cli -h`
   - `<site>-webmcp-cli <operation> -h`
   - `<site>-webmcp-cli <operation> field=value`
   - `<site>-webmcp-cli <operation> '{"field":"value"}'`
5. Use the UI link when a human needs to cooperate with the browser session:
   - login or MFA challenge
   - visual confirmation
   - human and AI editing the same page together
   - start the visible session with `<site>-webmcp-ui bridge.open`
   - if the user manually closes that window, the headed owner session ends; run `<site>-webmcp-ui bridge.open` again to start a new headed session on the same profile
   - close the visible session with `<site>-webmcp-ui bridge.close`
6. Parse JSON output only:
   - success path: `.ok == true`, consume `.data`
   - failure path: `.ok == false`, inspect `.error.code` and `.error.message`

## Link Contract

Every site gets two fixed commands:

- `<site>-webmcp-cli`: headless bridge for normal tool calls
- `<site>-webmcp-ui`: headed bridge for login and live collaboration

Both links must share the same site profile and daemon lock:

- profile path: `~/.uxc/webmcp-profile/<site>`
- daemon key: same as profile path

This shared-profile rule assumes one owner session for that site. Do not run independent headed and headless browser processes against the same profile at the same time.

The CLI link should stay deterministic:

- use `--headless`
- use `--no-auto-login-fallback`

The UI link should stay visible:

- use `--no-headless`

## Guardrails

- Prefer browser-side execution for privileged site actions. Do not move site credentials into local scripts.
- Do not share one `--user-data-dir` across multiple unrelated sites.
- If a site is sensitive to headed/headless switching, keep separate profiles for the two modes instead of forcing reuse.
- Do not dynamically rename link commands at runtime. The skill author chooses the link name once.
- For destructive writes, inspect tool help first and require explicit user intent.
- Use `--url` only for the site the user asked for. Do not silently redirect hosts.
