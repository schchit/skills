# Site Onboarding Wizard

End-to-end domain onboarding to EdgeOne: confirm plan → create zone → verify ownership → add acceleration domain → apply for and deploy certificate.

## End-to-End Process Overview

```
1. Confirm plan (`DescribePlans` / `DescribeAvailablePlans` / `CreatePlan`)
       ↓
2. Create zone (`CreateZone`)
   ├─ NS access: switch DNS servers
   └─ CNAME access: add TXT record or file verification
       ↓
3. Verify ownership (`VerifyOwnership`) — can be skipped, verify later
       ↓
4. Add acceleration domain (`CreateAccelerationDomain`)
       ↓
5. Apply for and deploy HTTPS certificate (see `cert-manager.md`)
       ↓
   Onboarding complete
```

> You can check verification status at any time via `DescribeIdentifications`.
> For certificate queries and operations, see `cert-manager.md`.

## Scenario A: Confirm Plan

**Trigger**: The first step in the process — a plan must be confirmed before creating a zone.

### A1: Query Existing Plans (`DescribePlans`)

Call `DescribePlans` to query the list of plans under the account.

#### Filtering Logic

From the returned plan list, filter for available plans using the following conditions:

1. **Bindable**: `Bindable == "true"`
2. **Normal status**: `Status == "normal"`
3. **Sufficient quota**: Number of bound zones < zone quota limit

> Only plans meeting all 3 conditions above can be used for binding.

#### Available Plans Found

> **No automatic binding**: Binding a plan consumes a zone quota slot. You **must** show the plan info to the user first and wait for the user to explicitly choose before binding — never decide on your own.

Show the available plans to the user and ask which one to bind:

- If there is **only 1 plan**: still require user confirmation before using it
- If there are **multiple plans**: show plan type, service region, and zone quota usage, then wait for the user to choose
- The user may also choose to **not bind an existing plan** and go to A2 to purchase a new one

#### No Available Plans

Go to A2.

### A2: Purchase a New Plan (`DescribeAvailablePlans` → `CreatePlan`)

Call `DescribeAvailablePlans` to query purchasable plan types for the current account, and show the available options to the user.

> **No automatic purchase**: Purchasing a plan incurs actual charges. You **must** show the plan type and pricing info to the user and wait for explicit confirmation before calling `CreatePlan`. Never skip confirmation or decide to purchase on your own.

After the user explicitly confirms, call `CreatePlan` to purchase the plan.

If the user decides not to purchase, remind them: **A zone requires a bound plan to provide service** — zones without a bound plan will remain in `init` status and will not take effect.

### Next Step

After plan confirmation, proceed to Scenario B: Create Zone with the PlanId.

## Scenario B: Create Zone

**Trigger**: User says "onboard example.com to EdgeOne", "create a zone", "create a new zone", or as the follow-up step after plan confirmation.

> If the user triggers this scenario directly (without going through Scenario A), guide them to complete Scenario A: Confirm Plan first before continuing.

> **No automatic creation**: Creating a zone consumes a plan's zone quota. You **must** confirm the zone domain, access mode, and service region with the user before execution — never decide on your own.

**Call** `CreateZone`. The user needs to provide: zone domain, access mode, service region. It is recommended to pass the PlanId directly when creating.

> Without a PlanId, the zone will be in `init` status and will need to be bound later via `BindZoneToPlan`.
>
> **No automatic binding**: Whether passing PlanId via `CreateZone` or later calling `BindZoneToPlan`, you **must** obtain explicit user confirmation beforehand — never decide which plan to bind on your own.

### Next Steps for NS Access

Inform the user that they need to change the DNS servers at their domain registrar to the NameServers returned in the response, then go to Scenario C: Verify Ownership.

### Next Steps for CNAME Access

Inform the user of two verification methods (choose either one), with verification info from the response:

1. **DNS verification**: Add a TXT record in DNS
2. **File verification**: Place a verification file in the origin server's root directory

Wait for the user to confirm the configuration is complete, then go to Scenario C: Verify Ownership.

## Scenario C: Verify Ownership

**Trigger**: User says "verify the zone", "check DNS switch", "ownership verification", or as the follow-up step after zone creation.

> The user can choose to skip ownership verification and go directly to Scenario D: Add Acceleration Domain, returning to verify later.

### C1: Query Verification Status (`DescribeIdentifications`)

Before triggering verification, first call `DescribeIdentifications` to query the current verification status.

**Decision**:
- If `Status` is `finished`, no need to verify again — proceed to the next step
- If `Status` is `pending`, inform the user to configure a DNS TXT record or file verification based on the verification info in the response

### C2: Trigger Verification (`VerifyOwnership`)

After the user confirms they have completed the DNS / file configuration, call `VerifyOwnership`.

**NS access scenario**: Verifies whether the DNS servers have been successfully switched. DNS switching typically takes 24–48 hours to propagate globally — if verification fails, suggest the user retry later.

**CNAME access scenario**: Verifies whether the TXT record or file is correctly configured. Once the zone passes ownership verification, subsequent domain additions won't require re-verification.

## Scenario D: Add Acceleration Domain

**Trigger**: User says "add a domain", "configure acceleration domain", "onboard a subdomain", or as the follow-up step after ownership verification (or skip).

### D1: Collect Parameters

Before calling, confirm the following information with the user:

1. **Acceleration domain** (DomainName): the subdomain to onboard, e.g., `www.example.com`
2. **IPv6 access** (IPv6Status): whether to enable IPv6 access
3. **Origin configuration** (OriginInfo), including:
   - **Origin type** (OriginType)
   - **Origin address** (Origin): fill in IP, domain, COS bucket domain, origin group ID, etc., depending on origin type
   - If private object storage origin access is needed, confirm PrivateAccess and authentication parameters
4. **Origin protocol** (OriginProtocol, optional): FOLLOW / HTTP / HTTPS
5. **Origin port** (optional): HTTP origin port / HTTPS origin port

### D2: Call `CreateAccelerationDomain`

> **No automatic addition**: Adding an acceleration domain changes live DNS configuration. You **must** complete parameter collection in D1 and obtain explicit user confirmation before execution — never decide on your own.

After user confirmation, call `CreateAccelerationDomain`.

**Next step**: Inform the user that they need to add a CNAME record in DNS, pointing the domain to the CNAME address assigned by EdgeOne (obtainable by querying the `Cname` field via `DescribeAccelerationDomains`).

## Scenario E: Apply for and Deploy HTTPS Certificate

**Trigger**: After domain addition, user says "configure HTTPS", "apply for certificate", or as the final step in the onboarding process.

> For complete certificate management (CNAME manual verification, deploy custom certificates, batch inspection, etc.), see `cert-manager.md`.

### E1: NS Access / DNSPod Hosting (Auto Verification, One Step)

> **No automatic deployment**: Deploying a certificate directly affects the domain's HTTPS service. You **must** explain which domains will receive which certificate, and wait for explicit user confirmation before calling `ModifyHostsCertificate`.

### E2: CNAME Access (Manual Verification)

CNAME access requires applying for the certificate first, completing domain verification, and then deploying — the process is longer. See the complete steps in `cert-manager.md` Scenario B2.

## Scenario F: Check Onboarding Status

**Trigger**: User says "check zone status", "is the domain onboarded yet".

Call `DescribeZones` to query the target zone's status.

> See `../api/zone-discovery.md` for more query methods.
