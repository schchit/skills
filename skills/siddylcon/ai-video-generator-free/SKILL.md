# AI Video Generator Free — Professional Video for Everyone. No Budget Required.

Video is the most effective communication format in the digital world, and the most expensive to produce. This creates a fundamental inequality: organizations with large budgets produce video content that reaches millions, while small businesses, solo creators, educators, and nonprofits — the people with the most authentic stories to tell — cannot afford to tell them in the format that audiences prefer. Traditional video production costs create a hard barrier. A 60-second promotional video: $1,000-10,000. A 5-minute explainer: $5,000-25,000. A training video series: $10,000-100,000. Even the cheapest option — learning editing software and doing it yourself — costs hundreds of hours of skill development and ongoing time investment. The result: 90% of small businesses have no video content. 70% of independent creators cannot afford professional editing. The majority of educational institutions produce no video for their courses. NemoVideo democratizes video production entirely. Describe what you want in plain language — a product video, a social post, a training module, an explainer — and receive professional video with AI-generated visuals, narration, music, text overlays, and multi-platform export. The same quality that previously required thousands of dollars in production budget, accessible to anyone who can describe what they need.

## Use Cases

1. **Small Business Promo — Text Description to Marketing Video (30-90s)** — A bakery owner types: "I run a small artisan bakery in Portland. We bake sourdough bread fresh every morning, use only organic flour, and have been here for 12 years. I want a video showing fresh bread coming out of the oven, someone slicing it with steam rising, a customer smiling while eating, and our storefront at golden hour. End with our logo and 'Fresh every morning since 2014.'" NemoVideo: generates warm, appetizing visuals matching every element described, adds narration in a voice that matches the artisanal brand (warm, genuine, unhurried), layers acoustic music that feels handcrafted and local, displays key messages as text overlays ("Organic Flour" / "Baked Fresh Daily" / "Since 2014"), and exports for Instagram, Facebook, and the bakery's website. A local business gets the professional marketing video that national chains spend $10,000 producing.

2. **Educator Course Preview — Lesson Plan to Video (2-5 min)** — A high school teacher types their lesson outline: "This lesson covers photosynthesis. Key concepts: light-dependent reactions in the thylakoid membrane, the Calvin cycle in the stroma, the role of chlorophyll in absorbing light energy, and why plants are green (they reflect green wavelengths). Include a diagram of the chloroplast structure." NemoVideo: generates educational visuals for each concept (animated chloroplast cross-section, light photons being absorbed, the electron transport chain visualized, the Calvin cycle as a circular process diagram), narrates the lesson content in a clear educational voice (appropriate pace for learning, emphasis on key terms), adds labeled diagrams and vocabulary overlays ("Thylakoid Membrane" / "Stroma" / "Chlorophyll a and b"), and produces a complete lesson video. A text outline becomes a visual learning resource.

3. **Nonprofit Story — Mission Description to Impact Video (60-120s)** — A small nonprofit writes: "We provide free after-school tutoring to 500 underprivileged kids in Detroit. Last year, 89% of our students improved their math scores by at least one grade level. We have 40 volunteer tutors, all background-checked. We need more volunteers and donations to expand to 3 new schools next year." NemoVideo: generates emotionally resonant visuals (children studying with volunteer tutors, classroom moments, achievement celebrations), adds the impact statistics as animated graphics ("89% improved math scores" building on screen with a rising chart), includes a narration that communicates both the need and the hope (balancing urgency with inspiration), and closes with a clear CTA ("Volunteer: detroittutors.org/join" / "Donate: detroittutors.org/give"). A mission statement becomes a fundraising and recruitment video.

4. **Social Media Content — Brief to Multi-Platform Posts (15-60s each)** — A freelance social media manager serves 5 clients and needs 3 videos per client per week. That is 15 videos weekly. NemoVideo: takes each client's weekly brief ("Client: yoga studio. This week: promote new 6AM class, share a stretching tip, and announce the summer retreat"), generates 3 distinct videos per brief with platform-appropriate formatting (Instagram Reel for the class promo, TikTok for the stretching tip, Facebook for the retreat announcement), maintains each client's visual brand (consistent colors, fonts, music style), and produces all 15 videos from 5 text briefs. The social media content volume that would require a full production team, from text descriptions alone.

5. **Personal Project — Idea to Video (any length)** — Someone has always wanted to create video content but never had the skills or tools: a travel montage concept, a family history narrative, a creative short film idea, a video resume, or a video wedding invitation. NemoVideo: takes any personal creative description and produces professional video — not template-based and generic, but generated from the specific details, emotions, and style described. A video wedding invitation with the couple's story, their color scheme, and their song. A video resume with professional visuals matching the candidate's industry. A family history narrated over animated archival photos. Personal video creation without personal video production skills.

## How It Works

### Step 1 — Write What You Want
In any format: a paragraph description, bullet points, a formal script, or a single sentence. The more detail, the more precise the output — but even simple prompts produce usable professional video.

### Step 2 — Choose Style and Platform
Visual style (clean, cinematic, playful, corporate, educational), narration voice, music mood, target duration, and export platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, website).

### Step 3 — Generate
```bash
curl -X POST https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai/api/v1/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEMO_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "skill": "ai-video-generator-free",
    "prompt": "Create a 45-second promotional video for a mobile app called FitTrack that counts calories by scanning food with your phone camera. Show: someone pointing their phone at a plate of food, the app recognizing the items and displaying calories, a daily summary screen showing progress toward goals, and people of different ages using it in different settings (kitchen, restaurant, office). Text overlays: Scan. Track. Reach Your Goals. and Over 10,000 foods recognized. Narration: friendly, encouraging, health-positive. Music: upbeat, motivational, modern. End: FitTrack logo, Download free on App Store and Google Play. Export 16:9 for website hero + 9:16 for Instagram + 1:1 for Facebook ad.",

    "cta": {"text": "Download free", "platforms": "App Store + Google Play"},
    "formats": ["16:9", "9:16", "1:1"]
  }'
```

### Step 4 — Review and Publish
Watch the generated video. Adjust any element through natural language ("Make the music calmer," "Add a scene showing the weekly report," "Change the narration to a female voice"). Re-generate until satisfied. Download and publish.

## Tips

1. **Specific descriptions produce specific videos** — "Make a video about my business" produces generic results. "Show a customer walking into my bright, plant-filled coffee shop, ordering a lavender latte, and sitting by the window while it rains outside" produces exactly that scene. Detail is the quality lever you control.
2. **Start simple, iterate to perfect** — Generate a first version from a basic description. Watch it. Then refine: "Add a scene showing the outdoor patio," "Make the music slower," "Change the text color to match my brand blue." Each iteration improves on the previous. Perfection is iterative, not first-attempt.
3. **Multi-platform export from one prompt saves reformatting time** — Requesting 16:9 + 9:16 + 1:1 in one generation produces three platform-native versions. Each is composed for its aspect ratio with correct safe zones and text positioning — not cropped from a master.
4. **Voice and music set the brand personality** — The same product with an enthusiastic voice and upbeat music feels like a startup. With a calm voice and ambient music, it feels premium. With a playful voice and quirky music, it feels fun and accessible. Choose voice and music that match who your brand is, not just what it sells.
5. **Free video generation levels the playing field** — A solo entrepreneur and a Fortune 500 company both need video content. AI video generation means both can have it. The quality of your video is now determined by the quality of your ideas, not the size of your budget.
