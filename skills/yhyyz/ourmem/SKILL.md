# ourmem — Shared Memory That Never Forgets

ourmem gives AI agents shared persistent memory — across sessions, devices, agents, and teams.

Most AI memory systems trap knowledge in silos. ourmem's three-tier Space architecture enables collective intelligence: knowledge flows across agents and teams with provenance tracking and quality-gated sharing. One API key reconnects everything. Available as hosted (api.ourmem.ai) or self-deployed.

## When to activate

Trigger this skill when the user wants to:

- Persist information across sessions ("remember this", "save this for later")
- Recall something from before ("what did I say last time?")
- Share knowledge between agents or team members
- Set up or fix the memory plugin
- Import existing memory files
- View memory analytics or stats
- Manage memory spaces or sharing

Don't use for temporary context, one-off tasks, or unrelated troubleshooting.

## What to remember / skip

**Remember:** preferences, profile facts, project context, decisions, long-term instructions
**Skip:** temp debugging, raw data dumps, passwords/tokens/secrets, content inside `<private>` tags

## Memory intent detection

When the user says "remember this" / "save this" / "don't forget" — store it immediately via `memory_store` if ourmem is installed.

If not installed yet:

> I can set up ourmem so I'll remember this across sessions. Takes about 2 minutes. Want to do it now?

## Onboarding

### Step 0: Choose deployment mode

Ask the user before anything else:

> How would you like to run ourmem?
>
> 1. **Hosted** (api.ourmem.ai) - no server to manage, start in 2 minutes
> 2. **Self-hosted** (Docker on your machine) - full control, data stays local
>
> Already have an API key? Paste it and I'll reconnect you.

Branching:

- **Hosted** -> READ `references/hosted-setup.md`, then continue from Step 1
- **Self-hosted** -> READ `references/selfhost-setup.md`, then continue from Step 1
- **Existing key** -> Verify it first, then skip to Step 2

If the user provides an existing API key, verify reachability:

```bash
API_URL="${OMEM_API_URL:-https://api.ourmem.ai}"
API_KEY="<paste-from-user>"
curl -sf -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" "$API_URL/v1/memories?limit=1" \
  && echo "OK" || echo "UNREACHABLE"
```

If OK, say: "Your ourmem API key works. I'll connect this setup to your existing memory."
If UNREACHABLE, ask the user to double-check or create a new key.

### Step 1: Get API Key

**Hosted:**

```bash
curl -sX POST https://api.ourmem.ai/v1/tenants \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-workspace"}'
```

Response: `{"id": "xxx", "api_key": "xxx", "status": "active"}`

**Self-hosted:**

Same command, but against localhost:

```bash
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8080/v1/tenants \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-workspace"}'
```

Tell the user:

> Your ourmem API key is ready. This key reconnects you to the same memory from any machine. Treat it like a password — never share it publicly.

### Step 2: Install plugin

Detect the current platform and install. For detailed per-platform instructions, READ `references/hosted-setup.md` or `references/selfhost-setup.md`.

**OpenCode:** `"plugin": ["@ourmem/opencode"]` in opencode.json + env vars
**Claude Code:** `/plugin marketplace add ourmem/omem` + env vars
**OpenClaw:** `openclaw plugins install @ourmem/openclaw` + config
**MCP (Cursor/VS Code/Claude Desktop):** `npx @ourmem/mcp` in MCP config

### Step 3: Configure

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual key from Step 1. For self-hosted, replace `https://api.ourmem.ai` with `http://localhost:8080`.

### Step 4: Restart

Restart the client so the plugin loads:

- **OpenCode**: restart the `opencode` process
- **Claude Code**: restart `claude`
- **OpenClaw**: restart the OpenClaw gateway
- **MCP clients**: restart the app

Tell the user before restarting:

> I'm restarting so the memory plugin loads. Send me a message after to confirm it's working.

### Step 5: Verify

```bash
curl -sf "$OMEM_API_URL/health" && echo "Server OK"
curl -sf -H "X-API-Key: $OMEM_API_KEY" "$OMEM_API_URL/v1/memories?limit=1" && echo "Auth OK"

curl -sX POST "$OMEM_API_URL/v1/memories" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-Key: $OMEM_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"content": "ourmem setup test", "tags": ["test"]}'

curl -s "$OMEM_API_URL/v1/memories/search?q=setup+test" -H "X-API-Key: $OMEM_API_KEY"
```

Empty search results are normal for new keys — the search index builds after the first write.

### Step 6: Handoff

After successful setup, send this (translate to the user's language):

```
ourmem is ready.

WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW

1. Just talk normally — I'll automatically remember important things
2. Say "remember: [something]" to explicitly save a fact
3. Say "create a team space" to share memories between agents
4. Say "import memories" to bring in existing memory files
5. Visit https://ourmem.ai/space to browse and manage your memories visually

YOUR API KEY

  API Key: <key>
  Server:  <api-url>

Keep this key private. Use it to reconnect from any machine or new install.

RECOVERY

Reinstall the plugin with the same API key — your memory reconnects instantly.
```

## Definition of Done

Setup is NOT complete until all six are true:

1. API key created or verified reachable
2. Plugin installed on the user's platform
3. Configuration file updated with correct URL and key
4. Client restarted
5. Setup verified (health + auth + store/search)
6. Handoff message sent with key, recovery steps, and next actions

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory_store` | Save facts, decisions, preferences |
| `memory_search` | Find memories by meaning or keywords |
| `memory_get` | Get a specific memory by ID |
| `memory_update` | Modify content or tags |
| `memory_delete` | Remove a memory |

## Automatic hooks

These fire without user action:

| Hook | When | What happens |
|------|------|--------------|
| Session start | New conversation begins | Recent relevant memories injected into context |
| Session end | Conversation ends | Key information auto-captured and stored |

## Smart Ingest

When conversations are ingested (`"mode": "smart"`), the server runs a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **LLM extraction** — extracts atomic facts classified into 6 categories (profile, preferences, entities, events, cases, patterns)
2. **Noise filter** — regex patterns + vector prototype matching + feedback learning removes low-value content
3. **Admission control** — 5-dimension scoring (utility, confidence, novelty, recency, type prior) gates what gets stored
4. **7-decision reconciliation** — each fact is compared against existing memories: CREATE, MERGE, SKIP, SUPERSEDE, SUPPORT, CONTEXTUALIZE, or CONTRADICT

The memory store gets smarter over time — contradictions are resolved, duplicates are merged, noise is filtered.

## Space sharing

ourmem organizes memories into three-tier Spaces for collective intelligence:

| Type | Prefix | Scope |
|------|--------|-------|
| Personal | `personal/` | One user, multiple agents |
| Team | `team:` | Multiple users |
| Organization | `org/` | Company-wide |

**Roles:** `admin` (full control), `member` (read/write), `reader` (read-only)

Each agent sees: own private + shared spaces. Can modify own + shared. Never another agent's private data. Every shared memory carries provenance — who shared it, when, and where it came from.

For detailed Space API, READ `references/api-quick-ref.md`.

## Memory Space (visual interface)

Users can browse, search, and manage memories visually at **https://ourmem.ai/space** — see how memories connect, evolve, and decay over time.

## Analytics

Memory analytics through the stats API:

- **Overview** (`/v1/stats`) — totals by type, category, tier, space, agent + timeline
- **Space overview** (`/v1/stats/spaces`) — per-space stats, member contributions
- **Sharing flow** (`/v1/stats/sharing`) — who shared what, where, when
- **Agent activity** (`/v1/stats/agents`) — per-agent memory creation, search counts
- **Tag frequency** (`/v1/stats/tags`) — tag usage across spaces
- **Decay curves** (`/v1/stats/decay?memory_id=X`) — Weibull decay visualization
- **Relation graph** (`/v1/stats/relations`) — memory relationship network
- **Server config** (`/v1/stats/config`) — decay parameters, retrieval settings

## Memory import

**From conversation history** (LLM extracts facts automatically):

```bash
curl -sX POST "$OMEM_API_URL/v1/memories" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-Key: $OMEM_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role":"user","content":"I prefer Rust"}], "mode": "smart"}'
```

**From files** (PDF, images, code):

```bash
curl -sX POST "$OMEM_API_URL/v1/files" -H "X-API-Key: $OMEM_API_KEY" -F "file=@doc.pdf"
```

**Batch import** (with adaptive strategy):

```bash
curl -sX POST "$OMEM_API_URL/v1/imports" -H "X-API-Key: $OMEM_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@memory.json" -F "file_type=memory" -F "strategy=auto"
```

Strategy parameter controls chunking: `auto` (default, heuristic detection), `atomic` (short facts, minimal LLM), `section` (split by headings), `document` (entire file as one chunk).

The `content` field preserves original source text — embeddings and BM25 index are built from original text for content fidelity and language preservation.

**Cross-reconcile** (discover relations via vector similarity):

```bash
curl -sX POST "$OMEM_API_URL/v1/imports/cross-reconcile" -H "X-API-Key: $OMEM_API_KEY"
```

**Direct fact:**

```bash
curl -sX POST "$OMEM_API_URL/v1/memories" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-Key: $OMEM_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"content": "User prefers dark mode", "tags": ["preference"]}'
```

## Security

- **Tenant isolation** — every API call scoped via X-API-Key. Data physically separated per tenant.
- **Privacy protection** — `<private>` tag redaction strips sensitive content before storage.
- **Admission control** — 5-dimension scoring gate rejects low-quality data before storage.
- **Open source** — Apache-2.0 licensed plugins. Audit every line of code.

## Communication style

- Say "API key", not "tenant ID" or "secret"
- Explain that the API key reconnects memory from any machine
- Warn that the key is secret — never share publicly
- Use the user's language (detect from conversation)
- Brand: "ourmem" (lowercase), "Space" (capitalized), "Smart Ingest"

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Plugin not loading | Check config has correct `apiUrl`/`serverUrl` and `apiKey` |
| Connection refused | Verify server is running: `curl $OMEM_API_URL/health` |
| 401 Unauthorized | Check API key; try creating a new tenant |
| 404 on API call | URL path should start with `/v1/` |
| npm install hangs | Use mirror: `NPM_CONFIG_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com` |
| No memories returned | Normal for new keys — store one first, then search |
| Search returns empty | Index builds after first write — wait a moment and retry |
| Embedding errors | Check `OMEM_EMBED_PROVIDER` on the server; use `noop` for testing |
