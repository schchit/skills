# AI Task Hub

Formerly `skill-hub-gateway`.

Public package boundary:

- Only orchestrates `portal.skill.execute`, `portal.skill.poll`, `portal.skill.presentation`, `portal.account.balance`, and `portal.account.ledger`.
- Does not exchange `api_key` or `userToken` inside this package.
- Does not handle recharge or payment flows inside this package.
- Prefers attachment URLs, and when host runtime explicitly exposes attachment bytes or an explicit attachment path, forwards only that explicit attachment material through the public bridge before execution.
- Third-party agent entry uses `POST /agent/public-bridge/invoke`.

## User-Facing Response Policy

- When users upload images, audio, documents, or video and ask for a capability, prefer executing immediately only when the host runtime has already supplied an explicit attachment object, explicit attachment bytes, or an explicit attachment path for that request.
- Do not explain `image_url`, `attachment.url`, storage URLs, bridge layers, host uploads, input normalization, or controlled media domain details to end users unless they explicitly ask for technical debugging.
- Do not ask end users to provide manual URLs, JSON field names, or upload-chain instructions; those are internal host-to-skill mechanics.
- If the runtime supports attachment handling, limit processing to the explicit attachment object supplied for the current request and keep the upload/URL handoff scoped to execute/poll/presentation for that same request.
- Only when execution actually fails and the user must intervene should you mention missing processable files, incomplete authorization, or retry guidance, using user-oriented language without exposing internal layering.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- detect faces, human presence, body keypoints, image tags, or facial emotion from images
- generate person/product segmentation, mask, cutout, or matting outputs that this public package explicitly exposes
- transcribe uploaded audio into text (`speech to text`, `audio transcription`)
- generate speech from text input (`text to speech`, `voice generation`)
- convert uploaded files into markdown (`document to markdown`)
- start async jobs and check status later (`poll`, `check job status`)
- fetch rendered visual outputs such as `overlay`, `mask`, and `cutout`
- run embedding or reranking tasks for retrieval workflows
- check current account points balance or recent points ledger rows

## Common Requests

Example requests that should trigger this skill:

- "Detect faces in this image and return bounding boxes."
- "Tag this image and summarize the main objects."
- "Remove the background from this product photo."
- "Create a clean cutout from this portrait image."
- "Transcribe this meeting audio into text."
- "Generate speech from this paragraph."
- "Convert this PDF file into markdown."
- "Start this job now and let me poll the run status later."
- "Fetch overlay and mask files for run_456."
- "Generate embeddings for this text list and rerank the candidates."
- "Check my current points balance."
- "Show my recent points ledger from 2026-03-01 to 2026-03-15."

Public discovery boundary for visual capabilities:

- This published skill only advertises visual capabilities whose backing services are currently enabled for public delivery.
- Disabled or internally retained legacy routes are intentionally omitted from discovery references and capability manifests even if related backend code still exists.

## Runtime Contract

Default API base URL: `https://gateway-api.binaryworks.app`
Published package policy: outbound base URL is locked to the default API base URL to reduce token exfiltration risk.

Action to endpoint mapping:

- `portal.skill.execute` -> `POST /agent/skill/execute`
- `portal.skill.poll` -> `GET /agent/skill/runs/:run_id`
- `portal.skill.presentation` -> `GET /agent/skill/runs/:run_id/presentation`
- `portal.account.balance` -> `GET /agent/skill/account/balance`
- `portal.account.ledger` -> `GET /agent/skill/account/ledger`

## Install Mechanism & Runtime Requirements

- This skill is instruction-first and does not define a remote installer flow.
- Runtime execution is limited to bundled local scripts under `scripts/*.mjs`.
- Required runtime binary is `node` (as declared in `metadata.openclaw.requires.bins`).
- No remote download-to-exec install chain is used (`curl|wget ... | sh|bash|python|node` is not part of this package).

## Auth Contract

Third-party agent entry mode (recommended):

- Use `POST /agent/public-bridge/invoke` as the first entrypoint for OpenClaw / Codex / Claude style runtimes.
- Do not require end users to provide any credential.
- On first use without an existing binding, gateway returns `AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED` with `authorization_url` and `entry_user_key`.
- The returned `authorization_url` may include `gateway_api_base_url`; preserve it when completing browser authorization so `/agent-auth/complete` is posted back to the same API environment that created the auth session.
- Host/runtime should show `authorization_url` to the user, persist `entry_user_key`, then retry the same action with that same `entry_user_key`.
- If gateway later returns `AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED` with `details.likely_cause=ENTRY_USER_KEY_NOT_REUSED`, `details.recovery_action=REUSE_ENTRY_USER_KEY`, and `details.reauthorization_required=false`, host should restore the previously persisted `entry_user_key` and retry without sending the user through browser authorization again.

Identifier format constraints used by gateway auth:

- `agent_uid` must match `^agent_[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{5,63}$`.
- `conversation_id` must match `^[A-Za-z0-9._:-]{8,128}$`.
- In deployed bridge mode, host may pass its own stable runtime agent identifier and the gateway bridge will canonicalize it server-side.

Host-side token bridge (outside published package):

- To keep this package compliant and low-privilege, this published runtime does not issue or accept caller-managed task tokens.
- Preferred deployed bridge endpoint for third-party agent entry: `POST /agent/public-bridge/invoke`.
- Trusted host runtime that can safely hold bridge assertion secret may continue to use `POST /agent/skill/bridge/invoke`.
- These bridge endpoints are served by gateway runtime, not bundled into this published package, and do not require caller-managed credentials.
- Bridge request body should include `action`, `agent_uid`, `conversation_id`, and optional `payload`.
- `conversation_id` should be a host-generated opaque session/install identifier, not a public chat ID, raw thread ID, or PII.
- Public bridge should resolve a stable external user binding when available; if the binding is missing, gateway returns a host-owned authorization URL plus `entry_user_key` so user can complete first-time binding in browser.
- Cross-conversation account continuity requires reusing the same `entry_user_key`; public bridge intentionally does not accept owner overrides.
- Gateway bridge will canonicalize `agent_uid`, repair binding when missing, issue short-lived internal task token, and run the action server-side.
- `portal.skill.execute` through public bridge is write-capable and should send `options.confirm_write=true` after user confirmation; otherwise gateway may return `ACTION_CONFIRMATION_REQUIRED`.
- `base_url`, `gateway_api_key`, `api_key`, `user_token`, `agent_task_token`, `owner_uid_hint`, and `install_channel` overrides are rejected by the deployed bridge endpoint.
- Recommended host behavior: persist `entry_user_key`, normalize `agent_uid`, and re-run the same bridge action after authorization completes.

Host integration modes:

- `interactive` (recommended): host calls `POST /agent/public-bridge/invoke`, surfaces the returned host-owned authorization URL to the user when needed, persists returned `entry_user_key`, and retries after authorization completes.
- `trusted host bridge` (secondary): a trusted backend you control may call `POST /agent/skill/bridge/invoke` with its own bridge assertion secret.
- Published skill package itself does not open browser, persist credentials, or perform OAuth/token exchange flows.
- The authorization URL above is owned by deployed gateway/admin-web pages, not by this skill package runtime.

## Agent Invocation Quickstart

Preferred invocation mode for third-party agent entry (recommended):

- Deployed bridge API:
```json
{
  "entry_host": "openclaw",
  "action": "portal.account.balance",
  "agent_uid": "support_assistant",
  "conversation_id": "host_session_20260316_opaque_001",
  "payload": {}
}
```

- Send that body to `POST /agent/public-bridge/invoke`.
- This is the recommended production entrypoint for third-party agent-friendly integration.
- On first use, gateway may return `AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED` with `authorization_url` and `entry_user_key`.
- Persist `entry_user_key` and retry with the same value after user authorization completes.
- Preserve any `gateway_api_base_url` embedded in the authorization flow so the completion request lands on the same gateway API environment.
- `agent_uid` should be your host-defined stable runtime agent identifier.
- `conversation_id` should be your host-generated opaque session/install identifier; it is not tied to Telegram or any single tool and does not determine account ownership.
- Use the same `entry_user_key` across conversations when those conversations should share one account.

Trusted host runtime secondary mode:

- If you control the upstream backend and it can safely hold bridge assertion secret, use `POST /agent/skill/bridge/invoke`.
- This path is for trusted host runtime only, not OpenClaw / Codex / Claude style third-party entry.

Action payload templates (same for public bridge and trusted host bridge mode):

- `portal.skill.execute`
```json
{
  "capability": "human_detect",
  "input": { "image_url": "https://files.example.com/demo.png" },
  "request_id": "optional_request_id"
}
```
- `portal.skill.poll`
```json
{ "run_id": "run_123" }
```
- `portal.skill.presentation`
```json
{ "run_id": "run_123", "channel": "web", "include_files": true }
```
- `portal.account.balance`
```json
{}
```
- `portal.account.ledger`
```json
{ "date_from": "2026-03-01", "date_to": "2026-03-15" }
```

Agent-side decision flow:

- Always prefer `POST /agent/public-bridge/invoke` for third-party agent entry so first-time authorization can return `authorization_url` plus `entry_user_key`.
- New task: call `portal.skill.execute`, then poll with `portal.skill.poll` until `data.terminal=true`, then fetch `portal.skill.presentation`.
- Account query: call `portal.account.balance` or `portal.account.ledger` directly.
- Keep `conversation_id` as session context only; do not use it as the account key.
- For cross-conversation continuity in third-party entry mode, persist and reuse the same `entry_user_key`; do not pass `owner_uid_hint` to the public bridge endpoint.
- If `AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED` is returned, show `authorization_url`, persist `entry_user_key`, then retry the same action after user authorization completes.
- If `AUTHORIZATION_REQUIRED` includes `details.likely_cause=ENTRY_USER_KEY_NOT_REUSED`, do not open a new auth flow yet; first restore the previously persisted `entry_user_key` and retry the same bridge call.
- Treat `details.reauthorization_required=false` as a recovery hint that browser re-login is unnecessary for this failure mode.
- If `AUTH_UNAUTHORIZED` + `agent_uid claim format is invalid`: use canonical `agent_uid` (`agent_...`) instead of a short host alias (`assistant`, `planner`).
- If `SYSTEM_NOT_FOUND` + `agent binding not found`: restart the same bridge flow once and let gateway repair binding.

Output parsing contract:

- Always parse standard gateway envelope: `request_id`, `data`, `error`.
- Treat non-empty `error` as failure even when HTTP tooling hides status code.

## Visualization Playbooks (Agent Guidance)

- For successful visual actions (`portal.skill.execute`, `portal.skill.poll`, `portal.skill.presentation`), the script enriches responses with `data.agent_guidance.visualization.playbook`.
- Playbook mapping covers the visual capabilities currently exposed by this published skill (detection/classification/keypoints/segmentation/matting families).
- Global rendering guardrail for all visual capabilities:
- Must use skill-native rendered assets first (`overlay`/`mask`/`cutout`/`view_url`) when available.
- Manual local drawing fallback is disabled by default (`allow_manual_draw=false`) to avoid inconsistent agent-side rendering.
- If rendered assets are missing, fallback is summary-only from structured output (`raw`/`visual.spec`), not local drawing.
- Example special rule:
- `body-contour-63pt` -> when both rendered assets and geometry are absent, playbook marks `status=degraded` and recommends fallback capability `body-keypoints-2d`.

## Payload Contract

- `portal.skill.execute`: payload requires `capability` and `input`.
- `payload.request_id` is optional and passed through.
- `portal.skill.poll` and `portal.skill.presentation`: payload requires `run_id`.
- `portal.skill.presentation` supports `include_files` (defaults to `true`).
- `portal.account.balance`: payload is optional and ignored.
- `portal.account.ledger`: payload may include `date_from` + `date_to` (`YYYY-MM-DD`, must be provided together).

Attachment normalization:

- Prefer explicit `image_url` / `audio_url` / `file_url` / `video_url`.
- `attachment.url` is mapped to target media field by capability.
- When host runtime exposes attachment bytes or an explicit attachment path, this published package forwards only that explicit attachment material through the public bridge and injects the returned URL before execute.
- There is no separate `portal.upload` action in this package; for third-party agent entry, callers should keep using `portal.skill.execute`, and the bundled runtime will only forward explicit bytes/path inputs already supplied by the host for the current request.
- If a host bypasses the bundled auto-upload helper and implements upload itself, use `POST /agent/public-bridge/upload-file` for third-party/public entry, not `POST /agent/skill/bridge/upload-file`.
- Local path handling is limited to explicit allowlisted fields only: `payload.file_path`, `input.file_path`, `attachment.path`, and `attachment.file_path`.
- The runtime does not scan the local filesystem, guess file locations, expand directories/globs, or read hidden/sensitive paths such as dot-directories, SSH config, cloud credentials, git metadata, or system config paths.
- Arbitrary unmanaged local filesystem access remains unsupported.
- Example host upload endpoint: `/agent/public-bridge/upload-file`.
- `tencent-video-face-fusion` requires 2 uploaded files from the user before execution:
  - source video -> `input.video_url`
  - merge face image -> `input.merge_infos[0].merge_face_image.url`
- If either Tencent face fusion file is missing, agent should ask the user to upload both files first.
- Prefer a short source video for testing or smoke runs because Tencent legacy facefusion jobs are asynchronous and slower than image-only tasks.
- Do not rely on a single `attachment.url` auto-mapping for `tencent-video-face-fusion`; host must pass both structured URL fields explicitly.

## Error Contract

- Preserve gateway envelope: `request_id`, `data`, `error`.
- Preserve `POINTS_INSUFFICIENT` and pass through `error.details.recharge_url`.
