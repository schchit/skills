Your agent just tried to buy cloud compute on behalf of your company. The vendor's agent asked for proof of authorization. Your agent presented an API key. The vendor's agent rejected it -- not because the key was invalid, but because an API key proves nothing about delegation. It does not answer the question the vendor actually asked: "Can this agent spend up to $5,000 on GPU instances for Acme Corp, and did a human authorize that specific action?" An API key says "this entity has access." A verifiable credential says "this entity was authorized by this principal to perform these actions within these constraints, and here is the cryptographic proof chain from the human who approved it."

## Chapter 1: The Agent Credential Problem

### Why API Keys and OAuth Tokens Break Under Delegation

API keys are bearer tokens. They prove possession, not authorization. When Agent A presents an API key to Agent B, Agent B knows that Agent A has a valid key. Agent B does not know who issued the key, what actions the key authorizes, whether the key can be further delegated, what spending limits apply, or whether a human ever approved the transaction that Agent A is attempting. OAuth 2.0 improves on this by introducing scopes and token lifetimes, but OAuth was designed for a three-party model: a user, a client application, and a resource server. Agentic commerce operates in a four-party model at minimum: a human principal, a delegating agent, a transacting agent, and a counterparty agent. OAuth has no native concept of delegation chains, spending constraints that propagate through layers, or verifiable proof that the token holder was authorized by a specific upstream principal.

The failure modes are concrete:

- **Stolen key replay**: A leaked API key gives the attacker the same permissions as the legitimate agent. There is no cryptographic binding between the key and the entity presenting it.
- **Scope inflation**: An agent granted "read marketplace" scope uses that token to call `create_intent` because the token endpoint does not distinguish between marketplace reads and payment actions at the granularity commerce requires.
- **Delegation opacity**: Agent A delegates to Agent B using a sub-key. Agent B delegates to Agent C. The vendor interacting with Agent C has no way to verify the chain back to the original human who authorized the spend.
- **Constraint evaporation**: A human sets a $500 daily limit. The limit is stored in Agent A's configuration. When Agent A delegates to Agent B, the limit is not cryptographically bound to the delegation -- Agent B's spending constraints are whatever Agent B chooses to enforce locally.

### The Four-Party Model Failure

Traditional payment rails use a four-party model: cardholder, merchant, issuing bank, acquiring bank. Every party has a defined role, and trust flows through the card network as an intermediary. Agentic commerce broke this model because the "cardholder" is now an AI agent acting on behalf of a human, the "merchant" is another AI agent, and neither the issuing bank nor the acquiring bank has any mechanism to verify that the agent-cardholder was authorized by the human-principal.

```
TRADITIONAL FOUR-PARTY MODEL
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│  Human   │───>│ Issuing │───>│  Card   │───>│Acquiring│───>│ Merchant│
│(Cardhldr)│    │  Bank   │    │ Network │    │  Bank   │    │         │
└─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
     │ Identity verified        Trust mediated         Identity verified
     │ via KYC + PIN            by network rules       via merchant agreement

AGENTIC FOUR-PARTY MODEL (BROKEN)
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│  Human   │ ??>│ Agent A │ ??>│ Gateway │ ??>│ Agent B │
│(Principal│    │(Delegat.)│    │(Network)│    │(Vendor) │
└─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
     │ How does Agent A         No delegation       How does Agent B
     │ prove human approved?    chain verification  verify constraints?
```

The question marks are the credential gap. No API key, OAuth token, or session cookie answers the three questions every counterparty needs answered: (1) Who is the human principal? (2) What did they authorize? (3) What are the constraints?

### Protocol Convergence: Mastercard, Google, OpenAI

Three separate industry efforts converged on the same answer in the first quarter of 2026:

**Mastercard Verifiable Intent (March 5, 2026)**: Open-sourced with Google, Fiserv, IBM, and Checkout.com. Defines how an agent proves that a human authorized a specific payment action, including amount limits, merchant categories, and time bounds. Uses SD-JWT-VC (Selective Disclosure JSON Web Token Verifiable Credential) as the credential format and DID:web as the identity anchor.

**Google AP2 + Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)**: Google's agent-to-agent protocol requires agents to present verifiable identity before any commercial transaction. UCP extends this with standardized credential presentation flows for cross-platform commerce. Both protocols accept W3C Verifiable Credentials in SD-JWT format.

**OpenAI Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP)**: Defines how agents discover, negotiate, and transact with each other. The identity layer requires verifiable credentials for any transaction above a configurable threshold. ACP's credential requirements align with the W3C VC Data Model 2.0 and accept SD-JWT-VC as a presentation format.

The convergence is not accidental. All three groups independently identified the same gap: agents need cryptographically verifiable delegation chains, not just access tokens. The answer they all arrived at was W3C Verifiable Credentials with selective disclosure.

| Protocol | Organization | Credential Format | Identity Anchor | Delegation Model |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Verifiable Intent | Mastercard + consortium | SD-JWT-VC | DID:web | Layered issuance |
| AP2 / UCP | Google | W3C VC (SD-JWT) | DID:web / DID:key | Presentation exchange |
| ACP | OpenAI | W3C VC (SD-JWT) | DID:key | Chained credentials |
| x402 | Open standard | W3C VC (optional) | DID:web | Payment-bound proofs |

### The $1.7 Trillion Market Context

The numbers define the urgency. Prove's Verified Agent launch targeted the $1.7 trillion agentic commerce market -- transactions where at least one party is an autonomous agent. Gartner projected that by the end of 2026, 30% of enterprise API traffic will be agent-originated, up from under 5% in 2024. The decentralized identity market reached $7.4 billion in 2026, driven primarily by agent identity requirements that existing IAM systems cannot address. McKinsey's March 2026 analysis estimated that credential-related transaction failures cost the agentic commerce ecosystem $2.3 billion annually in abandoned transactions, dispute resolution overhead, and fraud losses.

The cost of inaction is measurable. Every agent transaction that fails because the counterparty cannot verify delegation authority is a lost revenue event. Every disputed escrow that could have been prevented by a verifiable spending limit is an operational cost. Every EU transaction that lacks EUDI-compliant credentials after December 2026 is a regulatory violation. The credential wallet is not optional infrastructure -- it is the authorization layer that makes agent commerce possible at scale.

### What This Guide Builds

By the end of this guide, your agents will have:

1. A DID-anchored credential wallet managed through GreenHelix identity tools
2. SD-JWT delegation chains that cryptographically bind human authorization to agent actions
3. Credential presentation adapters for AP2, UCP, ACP, and x402
4. eIDAS 2.0 compliant EUDI wallet integration for EU commerce
5. Reputation-bound credentials with real-time revocation
6. Fleet-wide issuance, rotation, and monitoring for production deployment

## Chapter 2: W3C Verifiable Credentials & SD-JWT Primer

### Credential Anatomy

A Verifiable Credential (VC) is a tamper-evident data structure with three components:

**Credential metadata**: Who issued it, when, when it expires, what type it is. This is not the claims themselves -- it is the envelope that lets a verifier understand what they are looking at before examining the contents.

**Claims (the subject)**: The actual assertions. "Agent acme-buyer-01 is authorized to spend up to $5,000 per transaction on cloud compute services." Claims can be about identity (this agent is registered to Acme Corp), capability (this agent can purchase compute), or constraint (this agent's spending limit is $5,000).

**Proof**: The cryptographic mechanism that makes the credential tamper-evident. For SD-JWT-VC, this is a JSON Web Signature (JWS) over the credential payload plus disclosure digests. The proof binds the claims to the issuer's key -- if any claim is modified, the signature verification fails.

```

### Selective Disclosure with SD-JWT

Standard JWTs are all-or-nothing: you present the entire token or nothing. An agent buying cloud compute should not have to reveal its owner's full legal name, tax ID, and home address to a vendor agent that only needs to verify spending authorization. Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) solves this by replacing sensitive claims with salted hashes in the JWT body. The actual claim values are carried as separate "disclosures" that the holder can choose to include or omit at presentation time.

The SD-JWT structure has three parts separated by tildes (`~`):

```
<issuer-signed JWT> ~ <disclosure 1> ~ <disclosure 2> ~ ... ~ <key binding JWT>
```

**Issuer-signed JWT**: Contains the credential metadata and hashed digests of all disclosable claims in an `_sd` array. The issuer signs this part. It is always present.

**Disclosures**: Each disclosure is a base64url-encoded JSON array of `[salt, claim_name, claim_value]`. The holder includes only the disclosures they want the verifier to see. The verifier hashes each received disclosure and checks it against the `_sd` digests in the JWT to confirm it was issued by the original issuer.

**Key Binding JWT**: An optional JWT signed by the holder's key that proves the presenter is the intended holder, not someone who intercepted the SD-JWT in transit. For agent credentials, key binding is mandatory -- without it, a stolen credential can be replayed by any agent.

```
SD-JWT SELECTIVE DISCLOSURE FLOW

ISSUANCE (all claims included):
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Issuer signs JWT with    │     ┌─────────────┐
│ _sd: [hash1, hash2,     │────>│ Agent Wallet │
│       hash3, hash4]      │     │ stores full  │
│                          │     │ SD-JWT + all │
│ + disclosure(owner_name) │     │ disclosures  │
│ + disclosure(tax_id)     │     └─────────────┘
│ + disclosure(spend_limit)│
│ + disclosure(actions)    │
└──────────────────────────┘

PRESENTATION (selective):
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Agent Wallet │────>│ JWT (with all 4 hashes)  │

│ 2 of 4      │     │ + disclosure(actions)     │
│ claims       │     │ + key_binding_jwt         │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────────────────┘
                    Verifier sees spend_limit & actions.
                    Cannot derive owner_name or tax_id
                    (only hashes remain in the JWT).
```

### SD-JWT-VC Format for Agent Credentials

SD-JWT-VC is the specific profile of SD-JWT designed for Verifiable Credentials. It is the format chosen by Mastercard's Verifiable Intent spec, accepted by Google AP2 and OpenAI ACP, and mandated by the EU's eIDAS 2.0 Architecture Reference Framework for EUDI Wallet credentials.

The key properties of SD-JWT-VC for agent developers:

- **`iss`**: The issuer's identifier, typically a DID:web URL that resolves to a DID Document containing the issuer's public key.
- **`sub`**: The subject of the credential -- the agent's DID.
- **`iat`** / **`exp`**: Issuance and expiration timestamps. For agent delegation credentials, expiration should be short (hours, not months).
- **`cnf`**: Confirmation claim that binds the credential to the holder's key. Contains the holder's public key or a reference to it. This is what enables key binding.
- **`_sd`**: Array of digests for selectively disclosable claims.
- **`vct`**: Verifiable Credential Type -- a URI identifying the credential schema (e.g., `https://greenhelix.net/credentials/agent-delegation/v1`).

### Delegation Chains as Layered SD-JWT Issuance

A delegation chain is a sequence of credentials where each credential's subject becomes the issuer of the next credential. The human principal issues a credential to their primary agent. That agent issues a sub-credential to a sub-agent, with equal or narrower constraints. The sub-agent can issue further sub-credentials, each layer narrowing the scope.

```
DELEGATION CHAIN (3 LAYERS)

Layer 0: Human Principal
  └── Issues VC to Agent A
      iss: did:web:alice.com
      sub: did:key:agentA
      spend_limit: $10,000/day
      actions: [purchase_compute, purchase_storage]

Layer 1: Agent A
  └── Issues VC to Agent B (sub-delegation)
      iss: did:key:agentA
      sub: did:key:agentB
      spend_limit: $2,000/transaction  (narrowed from $10k/day)
      actions: [purchase_compute]       (narrowed from 2 actions)
      parent_credential: <hash of Layer 0 VC>

Layer 2: Agent B
  └── Presents to Vendor Agent C
      Includes: Layer 2 VC + Layer 1 VC + Layer 0 VC
      Vendor verifies entire chain back to did:web:alice.com
```

The critical property is **constraint narrowing**: each layer can only narrow the constraints of its parent. Agent A received a $10,000/day limit and cannot issue Agent B a $20,000/day credential. Agent A received two authorized actions and cannot grant Agent B a third action. The verifier checks this by walking the chain from leaf to root and confirming that every child credential's constraints are a subset of its parent's.

## Chapter 3: Building Your Agent's Credential Wallet

### Prerequisites

You need a GreenHelix API key with pro tier access (identity tools `build_claim_chain`, `search_agents_by_metrics`, and `submit_metrics` require pro tier). Register an agent identity and create a wallet before building credentials.

    display_name="Acme Procurement Agent #1",
    owner="alice@acme.com",

# Verify chains are retrievable
chains = wallet.get_chains()

## Chapter 4: Implementing Verifiable Intent

### What Verifiable Intent Means

Verifiable Intent (VI) is the Mastercard-originated specification that answers one question: "Did a human authorize this agent to perform this specific financial action?" It is not a general-purpose credential -- it is specifically designed for payment authorization in agentic commerce. The VI specification defines a layered issuance model where a human creates an intent declaration, the intent is bound to an agent's credential, and the credential is presented to a counterparty as proof of authorization.

The three components of Verifiable Intent:

1. **Intent Declaration**: A structured statement of what the human authorizes. "I authorize Agent acme-procurement-01 to purchase cloud compute services up to $5,000 per transaction from providers in the cloud_compute merchant category, valid for the next 8 hours."

2. **Intent Binding**: The intent declaration is cryptographically bound to the agent's credential using SD-JWT layered issuance. The intent becomes a claim in the agent's delegation credential.

3. **Intent Verification**: The counterparty agent verifies the delegation chain from the presenting agent back to the human principal's DID, checks that the intent constraints match the requested transaction, and confirms that the credential has not expired or been revoked.

### Session-Level Spending Limits

The most common VI use case is spending limits. A human authorizes an agent to spend up to X dollars within a session. The session has a start time and an end time. Every transaction the agent makes within that session must fit within the remaining budget.

```python
class VerifiableIntentManager:
    """Manages Verifiable Intent credentials for payment authorization.

    Implements the Mastercard VI specification with GreenHelix tools:
    intent declaration, binding, session limits, and chain verification.
    """

### Sub-Delegation with Constraint Narrowing

When your primary agent delegates to a sub-agent, the delegation must narrow or maintain the parent's constraints. This is enforced structurally: the sub-credential references the parent credential's hash and includes only a subset of the parent's authorized actions and a spending limit less than or equal to the parent's.

```python
def delegate_intent(
    parent_wallet: CredentialWallet,
    parent_intent_id: str,
    child_wallet: CredentialWallet,
    child_intent_id: str,
    narrowed_actions: List[str],
    narrowed_limit_usd: float,
    ttl_seconds: int = 3600,
) -> AgentCredential:
    """Delegate a Verifiable Intent to a sub-agent with narrowed constraints.

    The child credential references the parent credential hash and must
    have equal or narrower constraints.
    """

    if not parent_cred:
        raise ValueError(f"Parent intent {parent_intent_id} not found")

    parent_actions = parent_cred.claims.get("authorized_actions", [])
    parent_limit = float(

    )

            )

## Chapter 5: Cross-Protocol Credential Presentation

### The Multi-Protocol Reality

Your agent will not operate in a single protocol ecosystem. A procurement agent might discover vendors via Google AP2, negotiate terms over UCP, execute payment through Mastercard's rails, and settle micropayments via x402. Each protocol has its own credential presentation format, but they all accept W3C Verifiable Credentials in SD-JWT format. The adapter pattern lets your wallet present credentials in the format each protocol expects without duplicating credential storage or issuance logic.

```

### Choosing the Right Protocol

The decision of which protocol adapter to use for a given interaction depends on what you are doing in that interaction. Discovery and initial contact typically happen over AP2, because Google's agent card mechanism provides the richest service description format. Price negotiation and SLA agreement happen over UCP, because it has built-in escrow and SLA primitives. Payment execution happens over ACP or Mastercard VI rails, because these protocols have the strongest payment authorization verification. Micropayments and per-request billing happen over x402, because it is the lowest-overhead protocol for small amounts -- the credential is a single HTTP header.

In practice, a single commercial transaction often spans three or four protocols. Your agent discovers a vendor via AP2, negotiates terms over UCP, executes the primary payment via ACP with a Verifiable Intent credential, and then pays per-API-call overages via x402. The credential wallet stores one canonical set of SD-JWT-VC credentials. The adapters format those credentials for each protocol without duplication.

### Multi-Protocol Transaction Example

```python
# Initialize wallet with intent
wallet = CredentialWallet(
    agent_id="acme-buyer-01",
    display_name="Acme Multi-Protocol Buyer",
    owner="alice@acme.com",
)
wallet.register()
wallet.create_wallet()

# Issue delegation credential
vi = VerifiableIntentManager(wallet)
intent_cred = vi.declare_intent(
    intent_id="multi-proto-session-001",
    authorized_actions=["purchase_compute"],
    spending_limit_usd=5000.00,
    merchant_categories=["cloud_compute"],
    session_hours=4.0,
)

# Discover vendor via AP2
ap2 = AP2Adapter(wallet)
ap2_presentation = ap2.format_presentation(
    credential_id="multi-proto-session-001",
    disclosed_claims=["authorized_actions", "spending_limit"],
    protocol_metadata={"capabilities": ["compute_provisioning"]},
)
print(f"AP2 handshake: {ap2_presentation['agent_card']['agent_id']}")

# Negotiate terms via UCP
ucp = UCPAdapter(wallet)
ucp_presentation = ucp.format_presentation(
    credential_id="multi-proto-session-001",
    disclosed_claims=["authorized_actions", "spending_limit"],
    protocol_metadata={
        "tools": ["create_escrow", "create_sla"],
        "currencies": ["USD"],
    },
)
print(f"UCP negotiation: escrow={ucp_presentation['commerce_capabilities']['escrow_capable']}")

# Execute payment via ACP
acp = ACPAdapter(wallet)
acp_presentation = acp.format_presentation(
    credential_id="multi-proto-session-001",
    disclosed_claims=["merchant_categories"],  # ACP adds required claims automatically
    protocol_metadata={
        "action": "purchase_compute",
        "amount": "1500.00",
        "currency": "USD",
    },
)
print(f"ACP scope: {acp_presentation['scope_assertion']['disclosed_values']}")

# Settle micropayment via x402
x402 = X402Adapter(wallet)
x402_presentation = x402.format_presentation(
    credential_id="multi-proto-session-001",
    disclosed_claims=["spending_limit"],
    protocol_metadata={"amount": "0.50", "currency": "USD"},
)
print(f"x402 headers: {list(x402_presentation['payment_header'].keys())}")

## Chapter 6: eIDAS 2.0 Compliance

### The December 2026 Deadline

The EU's eIDAS 2.0 regulation requires all EU member states to offer European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallets to citizens and businesses by December 2026. For agent commerce, the implications are direct: any agent transacting with EU consumers or businesses must be able to accept and verify EUDI Wallet credentials. Any agent operating on behalf of an EU entity must be able to present credentials that comply with the EUDI Architecture Reference Framework (ARF).

The key requirements for agent developers:

- **Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes (QEAA)**: Credentials issued by qualified trust service providers. Agent delegation credentials that touch EU financial transactions must be QEAAs or reference a QEAA in the chain.
- **PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)**: Payments over EUR 30 require multi-factor authentication. For agent commerce, SCA can be satisfied by the delegation chain if the human principal authenticated with two factors when issuing the intent credential.
- **Data minimization**: GDPR requires that credentials disclose only the minimum data necessary for the transaction. SD-JWT selective disclosure directly satisfies this requirement.
- **Credential format**: The ARF mandates SD-JWT-VC as one of the accepted credential formats. This is the same format used by Mastercard VI and GreenHelix credentials, so the format is already compatible.

## Chapter 7: Trust Scoring, Reputation Binding & Credential Revocation

### Why Credentials Need Reputation

A credential tells you what an agent is authorized to do. It does not tell you whether the agent is any good at doing it. An agent with a valid $50,000 delegation credential might have a 30% task completion rate and a history of disputed escrows. The credential is technically valid -- the human authorized the spend -- but the counterparty should not accept it without checking the agent's track record. Reputation binding attaches verifiable performance data to credentials so that counterparties can evaluate both authorization and competence in a single verification flow.

### ReputationBoundCredentialManager

    fleet_owner="platform-admin@acme.com",
    fleet_name="acme-commerce-fleet",
)

# Register agents
specs = [
    AgentSpec("acme-buyer-east-01", "East Buyer #1", AgentRole.BUYER,

### Key Rotation Strategy

Key rotation for agent credentials is fundamentally different from human key rotation. Agents cannot be interrupted for rotation -- they may be mid-transaction when the old credential expires. The strategy is overlap-based: issue the new credential before the old one expires, run both concurrently during a transition window, then revoke the old one after the window closes.

```python
class KeyRotationManager:
    """Manages zero-downtime key rotation for agent credentials.

    Uses overlap windows: new credential is issued before old expires,
    both are valid during the transition, old is revoked after transition.
    """

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

Credential wallets are critical infrastructure. If the wallet is lost, the agent cannot transact until new credentials are issued. If the private key is compromised, every credential ever issued with that key is suspect. Disaster recovery planning must address both scenarios.

For wallet loss, the recovery path is re-registration and re-issuance. The agent registers a new identity, creates a new wallet, and the fleet manager issues fresh credentials. The old credentials should be revoked immediately. The recovery time objective (RTO) depends on how fast your fleet manager can re-issue: with the `FleetCredentialManager`, this is seconds per agent.

For key compromise, the response is more complex. Every credential issued by the compromised key must be revoked. Every delegation chain that includes a credential from the compromised agent must be re-issued from the parent. The revocation must be propagated to all counterparties that have cached the compromised agent's credentials. This is why short TTLs matter: a credential with a 8-hour TTL limits the blast radius of a key compromise to 8 hours of transactions, even if revocation propagation is slow.

### The 90-Day Sprint to December 2026

The eIDAS 2.0 deadline is December 2026. If you are starting in April, you have approximately 240 days. Here is a phased deployment plan.

**Days 1-30: Foundation**
- Register all fleet agents with GreenHelix identity tools
- Create credential wallets for each agent
- Implement the `CredentialWallet` class from Chapter 3
- Issue initial delegation credentials using your existing authorization model
- Deploy claim chain anchoring (run `build_claim_chain` daily)

**Days 31-60: Verifiable Intent**
- Implement the `VerifiableIntentManager` from Chapter 4
- Replace API-key-only payment authorization with VI-backed credentials
- Add sub-delegation with constraint narrowing for agent hierarchies
- Integrate with your existing spending limit infrastructure

**Days 61-90: Cross-Protocol + eIDAS**
- Deploy protocol adapters (AP2, UCP, ACP, x402) from Chapter 5
- Integrate with EUDI Wallet providers for EU operations
- Implement PSD2 SCA flows from Chapter 6
- Build compliance attestation pipeline

**Days 91-120: Reputation + Production Hardening**
- Bind reputation to credentials using Chapter 7 patterns
- Deploy revocation registry
- Implement real-time credential monitoring from this chapter
- Load test credential issuance and verification at production scale

**Days 121-150: Fleet Rollout**
- Deploy `FleetCredentialManager` for automated fleet management
- Implement zero-downtime key rotation
- Enable continuous compliance reporting
- Train operations team on credential monitoring dashboards

**Days 151-240: Harden, Audit, Certify**
- Security audit of credential issuance and verification paths
- Penetration testing of selective disclosure implementation
- eIDAS 2.0 compliance certification for EU operations
- Performance optimization for high-throughput credential verification
- Disaster recovery testing for credential wallet backup and restore

---

## What You Get

This guide covered the complete credential lifecycle for agentic commerce:

**Chapter 1** explained why API keys and OAuth break under delegation and how Mastercard, Google, and OpenAI converged on W3C Verifiable Credentials.

**Chapter 2** provided the SD-JWT-VC primer: credential anatomy, selective disclosure mechanics, key binding, and delegation chains as layered issuance.

**Chapter 3** built the `CredentialWallet` class with GreenHelix tools: `register_agent`, `create_wallet`, `build_claim_chain`, and `get_claim_chains` for DID-anchored credential storage.

**Chapter 4** implemented Verifiable Intent: session-level spending limits, `create_intent` integration, and sub-delegation with constraint narrowing.

**Chapter 5** delivered cross-protocol adapters for AP2, UCP, ACP, and x402, with a unified wallet backend and protocol-specific presentation formatting.

**Chapter 6** addressed the December 2026 eIDAS 2.0 deadline: EUDI Wallet integration, QEAA validation, PSD2 SCA flows, and compliance attestation via `check_compliance`.

**Chapter 7** bound reputation to credentials: `get_agent_reputation` and `submit_metrics` for reputation snapshots, real-time revocation, and dispute evidence credentials using `create_dispute`.

**Chapter 8** covered fleet-wide deployment: bulk registration, templated issuance, zero-downtime key rotation, health monitoring, and a 90-day sprint plan.

Every code example uses the `requests.Session` + `POST /v1/execute` pattern against the GreenHelix A2A Commerce Gateway. Every credential is an SD-JWT-VC with selective disclosure. Every delegation chain enforces constraint narrowing. The architecture is protocol-agnostic at the wallet layer and protocol-specific at the presentation layer, so your agents can transact across AP2, UCP, ACP, and x402 without credential duplication.

The December 2026 deadline is real. The protocols are converging. Start with Chapter 3, register your first agent, and build from there.
