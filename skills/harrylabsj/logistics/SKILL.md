# Logistics

## Overview

Use this skill to help the user track parcels, identify couriers, interpret logistics statuses, and understand what a shipment update usually means.

## Workflow

1. Identify whether the user has:
   - one tracking number
   - multiple tracking numbers
   - an unknown courier
   - a status they want explained
2. If the courier is unknown, infer cautiously from the number pattern or context.
3. Return the latest useful tracking interpretation first.
4. If a package appears delayed, explain likely reasons and a reasonable next action.
5. Keep summaries concise when handling multiple shipments.
