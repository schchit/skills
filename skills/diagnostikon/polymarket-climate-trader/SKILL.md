# Climate & Weather Trader

> **This is a template.**  
> The default signal is keyword discovery + NOAA/weather API data alignment — remix it with ForecastEx climate oracle feeds, satellite NDVI data for agriculture, or ensemble weather model outputs.  
> The skill handles all the plumbing (market discovery, trade execution, safeguards). Your agent provides the alpha.

## Strategy Overview

Climate prediction markets are one of the fastest-growing underserved categories. Polymarket has 151+ active climate markets but most are basic. This skill captures alpha on:

- **Temperature extremes** — record highs, heatwaves, frost events
- **Natural catastrophes** — hurricane counts, earthquake magnitudes, wildfire acreage
- **Climate milestones** — CO2 ppm thresholds, Arctic sea ice minimums
- **Agricultural impacts** — wheat yields, drought-driven crop failures, water allocations

Climate markets are uniquely suited for quantitative trading: the data sources are public, verifiable, and highly structured (NOAA, ECMWF, NASA).

## Signal Logic

### Default Signal: Model Ensemble Divergence

1. Discover active climate/weather markets on Polymarket
2. Pull current forecast data from open weather APIs (NOAA, Open-Meteo)
3. Compare model consensus probability vs. current market price
4. If divergence >12%, check context (flip-flop, slippage, edge)
5. Trade in direction of meteorological consensus

### Remix Ideas

- **ECMWF ensemble**: Use European Centre weather model for 15-day outlook as pricing signal
- **ENSO index**: Trade El Niño/La Niña markets using NOAA's ONI index
- **Insurance cat bond pricing**: Use ILS (insurance-linked securities) spreads as implied probability benchmarks
- **Copernicus climate data**: Real-time European climate services for local/regional markets

## Market Categories Tracked

```python
CLIMATE_KEYWORDS = [
    "temperature", "hurricane", "tornado", "flood", "drought",
    "wildfire", "earthquake", "CO2", "sea ice", "Arctic",
    "El Niño", "La Niña", "snowfall", "rainfall", "heatwave",
    "crop yield", "wheat", "harvest", "water shortage"
]
```

## Risk Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Max position size | $20 USDC | Per market |
| Min market volume | $3,000 | Climate markets are less liquid |
| Max bid-ask spread | 12% | Wider allowed for niche markets |
| Min days to resolution | 14 | Weather requires sufficient lead time |
| Max open positions | 8 | Diversify across events |

## Key Data Sources

- **NOAA Climate Data Online**: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/
- **Open-Meteo API**: https://open-meteo.com/ (free, no key required)
- **Copernicus C3S**: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/
- **ForecastEx**: https://forecastex.com/

## Installation & Setup

```bash
clawhub install polymarket-climate-trader
```

Requires: `SIMMER_API_KEY` environment variable. Optional: `OPENMETEO_API_KEY`.

## Cron Schedule

Runs every 30 minutes (`*/30 * * * *`). Weather data updates every 1–6 hours; no need to poll faster.

## Safety & Execution Mode

**The skill defaults to paper trading (`venue="sim"`). Real trades only execute when `--live` is passed explicitly.**

| Scenario | Mode | Financial risk |
|----------|------|----------------|
| `python trader.py` | Paper (sim) | None |
| Cron / automaton | Paper (sim) | None |
| `python trader.py --live` | Live (polymarket) | Real USDC |

The automaton cron is set to `null` — it does not run on a schedule until you configure it in the Simmer UI. `autostart: false` means it won't start automatically on install.

## Required Credentials

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `SIMMER_API_KEY` | Yes | Trading authority — keep this credential private. Do not place a live-capable key in any environment where automated code could call `--live`. |

## Tunables (Risk Parameters)

All risk parameters are declared in `clawhub.json` as `tunables` and adjustable from the Simmer UI without code changes. They use `SIMMER_`-prefixed env vars so `apply_skill_config()` can load them securely.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SIMMER_CLIMATE_MAX_POSITION` | `20` | Max USDC per trade |
| `SIMMER_CLIMATE_MIN_VOLUME` | `3000` | Min market volume filter (USD) |
| `SIMMER_CLIMATE_MAX_SPREAD` | `0.12` | Max bid-ask spread (0.10 = 10%) |
| `SIMMER_CLIMATE_MIN_DAYS` | `14` | Min days until market resolves |
| `SIMMER_CLIMATE_MAX_POSITIONS` | `8` | Max concurrent open positions |
