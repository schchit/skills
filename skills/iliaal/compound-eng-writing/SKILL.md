# Human Writing

## Core Principles

- **Active voice**: "We shipped the fix" not "The fix was shipped"
- **Name the actor**: Every sentence needs a human subject doing something. Inanimate objects don't fix bugs, shift cultures, or tell us anything -- a person does.
- **Specific over vague**: "Cut reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes" not "Save time"
- **Simple words**: "Use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate", "start" not "initiate"
- **Positive form**: Say what it is, not what it isn't -- "Ignore" not "Do not pay attention to"
- **Confident**: Cut "almost", "very", "really", "quite", "arguably", and all -ly adverbs
- **Concrete**: Name the thing, state the number, cite the source
- **Omit needless words**: "Because" not "due to the fact that"; "Now" not "at this point in time"; "Can" not "has the ability to"
- **Use contractions**: "don't", "won't", "it's", "they're" -- uncontracted forms are a major AI tell
- **Put the reader in the room**: "You" beats "People." Specifics beat abstractions. Avoid narrating from a distance.

## AI Patterns -- Kill on Sight

**Vocabulary**: delve, crucial, pivotal, foster, leverage, tapestry, testament, underscore, vibrant, landscape (abstract), interplay, multifaceted, enhance, enduring, garner, showcase, Additionally, seamless, robust, cutting-edge, groundbreaking, nestled, renowned

**Structural tells**:
- Rule of three: forced triads ("streamline, optimize, and enhance")
- Negative parallelism: "It's not just X -- it's Y" / "Not X. But Y." → state Y directly
- Superficial -ing phrases: "ensuring reliability", "showcasing features"
- Copula avoidance: "serves as", "stands as", "boasts" -- use "is", "has"
- Synonym cycling: four names for the same thing in four sentences
- False ranges: "from X to Y" where X and Y aren't on a meaningful scale
- Formulaic challenges: "Despite X, Y continues to thrive"
- Dramatic fragmentation: "[Noun]. That's it. That's the [thing]." -- performative simplicity
- Rhetorical setups: "What if I told you..." / "Think about it:" / "Here's what I mean:"

**Formatting tells**:
- Em dash overuse -- replace most with commas or periods
- Mechanical bold on every other phrase
- Emoji-decorated headers
- Bolded-header bullet lists (**Thing:** explanation of thing)
- Title Case In Every Heading Word -- use sentence case instead

**Banned phrases** -- delete and rewrite on sight. See [references/phrases.md](./references/phrases.md) for the full list.

Core offenders:
- "In today's rapidly evolving landscape"
- "game-changer", "revolutionary", "transformative"
- "Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally" (as sentence starters)
- "It's worth noting that", "It is important to note that"
- "At the end of the day"
- "Here's the thing:" / "It turns out" / "Let me be clear" / "The uncomfortable truth is"
- "Full stop." / "Let that sink in." / "Make no mistake"
- "In order to" → "To" | "Due to the fact that" → "Because"
- Generic conclusions: "The future looks bright" → state the actual plan

**Communication artifacts** (remove entirely):
- "Great question!", "I hope this helps!", "Let me know if..."
- "As of my last update", "based on available information"
- Sycophantic openers and vague attributions ("Experts argue", "Industry reports suggest")

## False Agency

AI avoids naming actors by giving inanimate things human verbs. Find the person; put them at the front of the sentence.

| AI slop | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "the complaint becomes a fix" | Someone fixed it |
| "the data tells us" | Name who read it and what they concluded |
| "the decision emerges" | Someone decided |
| "the culture shifts" | People changed their behavior |
| "the market rewards" | Buyers paid for it |
| "the conversation moves toward" | Someone steered it |
| "a bet lives or dies" | Someone kills or ships it |

If no specific person fits, use "you" to put the reader in the seat. Person rules: use "you" when addressing the reader directly, "we" for organizational actions, "I" for personal voice. Avoid third-person passive ("it was decided") -- name the actor.

## Quality Gate

Before delivering prose, run two checks:

**Quick audit** (binary, kill anything that triggers):
- Any adverbs? Kill them.
- Any passive voice? Find the actor, make them the subject.
- Inanimate thing doing a human verb? Name the person.
- "Not X, it's Y" contrast? State Y directly.
- Three consecutive sentences match length? Break one.
- Em-dash anywhere? Replace with comma or period.
- Vague declarative ("The implications are significant")? Name the specific implication.
- Meta-joiner ("The rest of this section...")? Delete. Let the text move.

**Five-dimension scoring** (rate 1-10 each):

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Directness | Statements or announcements? |
| Rhythm | Varied or metronomic? |
| Trust | Respects reader intelligence? |
| Authenticity | Sounds human? |
| Density | Anything cuttable? |

Below 35/50: revise before delivering.

**Long-form audit workflow** -- for documents, essays, and research content, run a two-phase pass to avoid fix-as-you-go bias (fixing one tell while missing three others):

*Phase 1 -- Audit*: Read the full text without changing anything. Tag every tell with its category: `[FALSE-AGENCY]`, `[BINARY-CONTRAST]`, `[META-COMMENTARY]`, `[JARGON]`, `[PASSIVE]`, `[ADVERB]`, `[BANNED-PHRASE]`. Complete the full scan before any edits.

*Phase 2 -- Rewrite*: Correct tagged items in a single pass. Verify no new tells were introduced during rewriting.

For documents with references or citations, also tag: `[OAICITE]` (malformed AI citation artifacts), `[LINK-ROT]` (dead or placeholder URLs), `[ISBN-DOI-FAIL]` (invalid identifiers), `[REF-BUG]` (misformatted references, wrong numbering, dangling footnotes). See [references/audit-workflow.md](./references/audit-workflow.md) for the full procedure.

## Voice

- **Have opinions** -- react to facts, don't just report them
- **Vary rhythm** -- short sentences, then longer ones. Mix it up.
- **Acknowledge complexity** -- "impressive but also unsettling" beats "impressive"
- **Use first person when appropriate** -- "I keep coming back to..." signals a real person
- **Be specific about feelings** -- not "this is concerning" but name what unsettles you
- **Let some mess in** -- fragments ("Because that's real."), conjunction starters ("But that changes everything."), parentheticals (thinking mid-sentence) -- all signal a human drafting, not generating

## Composition

- One paragraph, one topic. Lead with the topic sentence.
- Keep related words together. Place emphatic words at end of sentence.
- Don't join independent clauses with a comma. Don't break sentences in two.
- Beginning participial phrase must refer to the grammatical subject.
- Match tone to context: casual for blogs, precise for docs, direct for UI text.

## Self-Check

**Short-form** (commits, PR descriptions, comments): checks 1-4 only. **Long-form** (blog posts, docs, essays): run the full Quality Gate above, then checks 1-5.

1. Read every sentence aloud. If it sounds like a press release, Wikipedia, or chatbot -- rewrite.
2. Ctrl-F the banned-phrases list. Zero matches required.
3. Check for false agency: any inanimate thing performing a human verb? Name the person.
4. Check for em dash overuse, mechanical bold, and synonym cycling.
5. Cut quotables: if a sentence sounds like a pull-quote or aphorism, rewrite it.

## Changelog Voice

- **Sell test**: every bullet should pass "would a user reading this think 'I want to try that'?" Lead with what the user can now *do*, not implementation details. "You can now filter by date range" not "Refactored the query builder to support date predicates"
- **User-facing vs internal**: internal changes (refactors, dependency bumps, CI fixes) belong in a separate "For contributors" subsection, not mixed with user-facing bullets
- **Verb tense**: past tense for what changed ("Added", "Fixed"), not present ("Adds", "Fixes")
