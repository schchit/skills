# Ghost Publishing Workflows

Proven workflows from real production use on a Ghost Pro site.

---

## Credentials Setup

**Credentials file:** `~/.openclaw/credentials/ghost-admin.json`
```json
{
  "url": "https://your-site.ghost.io",
  "key": "id:secret"
}
```

Stored at: `~/.openclaw/credentials/ghost-admin.json`

**Get your key:** Ghost Admin > Settings > Integrations > Add custom integration > Admin API Key.

This single integration token covers the full publishing workflow: post creation, updates, image uploads, newsletter sends, batch operations, analytics reads.

---

## Workflow 1: Write and Publish a New Article

1. Generate JWT token (see api.md)
2. POST to `/posts/?source=html` with:
   - `status: "draft"` to start
   - Full HTML content (see HTML Content Guidelines below)
   - Tags, excerpt, feature_image if ready
3. Review in Ghost admin browser if needed
4. Update post: PUT with `status: "published"` and `email_segment: "all"` to publish + send newsletter simultaneously

**Critical:** Ghost publish + newsletter send is ONE action. Don't publish first then try to send separately — you'll need to use Ghost admin to resend, which is clunky.

---

## Workflow 2: Migrate from Squarespace (Proven — full blog migrated in one afternoon)

**What you'll need:**
- Squarespace XML export (Settings → Advanced → Import/Export)
- Node.js script to parse and batch import

**The migration script pattern (Node.js):**

This workflow requires one third-party npm package. Install it before running:

```bash
npm install fast-xml-parser
```

```js
const { XMLParser } = require('fast-xml-parser');
// Parse items from channel.item array
// For each post: clean HTML, generate slug, set published_at from pubDate
// POST to Ghost API with 500ms delay between calls
```

**Key cleanup steps:**
1. Strip Squarespace wrapper divs and widget markup
2. Convert Squarespace image URLs → either re-upload to Ghost or keep external
3. Clean slugs (remove date prefixes like `/2015/10/25/`, normalize to hyphen-case)
4. Set `published_at` from original post date to preserve chronology
5. Map categories → Ghost tags

**WordPress migration:** Same pattern, different XML schema. WordPress uses `<wp:post_name>` for slugs, `<content:encoded>` for HTML body.

**Substack migration:** Export CSV + HTML files from Substack dashboard. Parse CSV for metadata, read HTML files for content. Same batch POST pattern.

---

## Workflow 3: Batch Update Existing Posts

Use case: Update feature images, fix formatting across many posts, add tags, change slugs.

```js
// 1. Fetch all posts with pagination
GET /posts/?limit=15&page=1&fields=id,title,slug,status,updated_at,feature_image

// 2. Loop through pages until meta.pagination.next is null

// 3. For each post that needs updating:
PUT /posts/{id}/ with updated_at from fetched post
// 500ms delay between calls
```

**Always include `updated_at`** from the fetched post — Ghost uses optimistic locking and will 409 without it.

---

## Workflow 4: Upload Image and Set as Feature Image

**Use Python requests — not curl.** Curl multipart uploads silently fail on macOS zsh with certain file paths. Python requests is the reliable path.

```python
import requests, json, subprocess

creds = json.load(open('/Users/you/.openclaw/credentials/ghost-admin.json'))
GHOST_URL = creds['url']

def get_token():
    # Uses the Node.js ghost-token.js script from references/api.md
    return subprocess.check_output(['node', 'scripts/ghost-token.js']).decode().strip()

headers = {'Authorization': f'Ghost {get_token()}', 'Accept-Version': 'v5.0'}

# 1. Upload image
with open('/path/to/image.jpg', 'rb') as f:
    r = requests.post(
        f'{GHOST_URL}/ghost/api/admin/images/upload/',
        headers=headers,
        files={'file': ('image.jpg', f, 'image/jpeg')},
        data={'purpose': 'image'}
    )
image_url = r.json()['images'][0]['url']

# 2. Set as feature image + OG image on a post (fetch updated_at first)
post = requests.get(f'{GHOST_URL}/ghost/api/admin/posts/{POST_ID}/', headers=headers).json()['posts'][0]
requests.put(
    f'{GHOST_URL}/ghost/api/admin/posts/{POST_ID}/',
    headers=headers,
    json={"posts": [{
        "id": POST_ID,
        "updated_at": post['updated_at'],
        "feature_image": image_url,
        "og_image": image_url,
        "twitter_image": image_url,
    }]}
)
# Replace /posts/ with /pages/ for page resources
```

---

## HTML Content Guidelines

Ghost accepts raw HTML via `?source=html`. Inject a full HTML string as the `html` field.

**Standard structure:**
```html
<p>Opening paragraph.</p>

<h2>Section heading</h2>

<p>Body paragraph.</p>

<hr>

<p>Closing paragraph.</p>
```

**Book-style typography** (for literary/fiction content):
```html
<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; text-align: justify; hyphens: auto; -webkit-hyphens: auto; lang='en'">
  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0;">First paragraph of story.</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0;">Second paragraph — no gap between paragraphs, indent only.</p>
</div>
```

Key book-style rules:
- `text-align: justify` + `hyphens: auto` — justified text with hyphenation
- `text-indent: 2em` on paragraphs — indent instead of gap
- `margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0` — no paragraph spacing
- Wrap in `lang="en"` for hyphenation to work
- `font-family: Georgia, serif` for book feel

**YouTube embed (responsive):**
```html
<figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card">
  <iframe width="560" height="315"
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/{VIDEO_ID}"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen>
  </iframe>
</figure>
```

**Email newsletter rules (critical):**
- JS is stripped in Ghost email delivery — no interactive elements
- Subscribe widgets are web-only — stripped from email
- Ghost wraps articles in its own email template — don't add email headers/footers in HTML
- Keep email-safe: no `<script>`, no `position: fixed`, no complex CSS
- Ghost email send is one-shot — publish + `email_segment` in the same API call

**Footer template (standard newsletter CTA):**
```html
<hr>
<p><em>If you're reading this on the web, you can get articles straight to your inbox — 
no spam, unsubscribe anytime.</em></p>
```

---

## Workflow 5: DOCX Fiction/Essay Collection Batch Import

Use case: Import a collection of stories or essays from a DOCX as individual Ghost posts with book-style formatting.

**Source:** DOCX converted to HTML, then parsed piece by piece.

**Story detection:** Each piece starts with an `<h2>` tag (title). Split the full HTML on `<h2>` boundaries.

**Per-post structure:**
```html
<!-- Inline title -->
<h1 style="font-family: Georgia, serif; text-align: center;">{TITLE}</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center; color: #666;">{AUTHOR NAME}</h3>
<hr>

<!-- Book-style body -->
<div style="font-family: Georgia, serif; text-align: justify; hyphens: auto; -webkit-hyphens: auto;" lang="en">
  {PARAGRAPHS with text-indent styling}
</div>

<!-- YouTube embed if applicable -->
{EMBED}

<!-- Footer -->
<hr>
<p><em>Footer text here.</em></p>
```

**Tags:** Match your collection name and content type (e.g., `["Fiction", "Short Stories"]`)

**Slug pattern:** `story-title` or `story-title-author-name`

**Status:** `draft` initially — review before publishing.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **409 on PUT** — Always re-fetch post to get current `updated_at` before updating
- **Email not sending** — `email_segment` only fires on first publish. If post was already published, use Ghost admin to send manually
- **HTML rendering wrong** — Always use `?source=html` parameter on POST/PUT
- **Token expired mid-batch** — Regenerate token every 50 posts in long batch operations
- **Rate limiting** — Add 500ms delay between API calls in batch scripts; Ghost will 429 without it
- **Image upload fails** — Check file size (under 10MB), format (JPG/PNG/GIF/WebP), and that purpose field is set

---

## Workflow 6: YouTube Video Post (Thumbnail + Embed)

Use case: Publish a post built around a YouTube video — custom thumbnail as feature image, embedded player, structured content around it.

**Step 1: Upload your custom thumbnail as the feature image**
```bash
curl -s -X POST "{url}/ghost/api/admin/images/upload/" \
  -H "Authorization: Ghost {token}" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/thumbnail-1280x720.jpg" \
  -F "purpose=image"
# Copy the returned URL
```

**Step 2: Create the post with embed + feature image**
```json
{
  "posts": [{
    "title": "Video Title",
    "html": "<p>Intro paragraph setting up the video.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/{VIDEO_ID}\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>\n\n<p>Description or transcript excerpt below the video.</p>",
    "feature_image": "https://your-ghost-site.com/content/images/returned-thumbnail-url.jpg",
    "status": "published",
    "email_segment": "all",
    "tags": [{"name": "Video"}]
  }]
}
```

**YouTube embed rules:**
- Use `youtube-nocookie.com` not `youtube.com` — avoids cookie consent banners
- `kg-card kg-embed-card` classes tell Ghost to render it as an embed card (proper responsive sizing)
- Thumbnail dimensions: 1280×720 (16:9) — Ghost crops to this for feature image display
- The embed renders in email but autoplay is blocked — acceptable behavior

---

## Workflow 7: Content Formatting Recipes

Copy-paste HTML patterns for common Ghost content needs.

**Pull quote:**
```html
<blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #c8a84b; padding-left: 1em; font-style: italic; color: #555;">
  The sentence you want to emphasize.
</blockquote>
```

**Callout box:**
```html
<div style="background: #f9f5e7; border: 1px solid #e8d5a3; border-radius: 4px; padding: 1em 1.25em; margin: 1.5em 0;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Your callout text here.
</div>
```

**Section separator (thematic break):**
```html
<hr style="border: none; border-top: 1px solid #e0e0e0; margin: 2em 0;">
```

**Image with caption:**
```html
<figure>
  <img src="https://image-url.jpg" alt="Description">
  <figcaption style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.85em; color: #888; margin-top: 0.5em;">Caption text here.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

**Footnote-style aside:**
```html
<p style="font-size: 0.85em; color: #777; border-top: 1px solid #eee; padding-top: 0.75em; margin-top: 2em;">
  ¹ Footnote or clarification text here.
</p>
```

**Two-column layout (web-only — stripped in email):**
```html
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 1.5em;">
  <div><p>Left column content.</p></div>
  <div><p>Right column content.</p></div>
</div>
```

## Workflow 8: Newsletter Strategy Patterns

Hard-won Ghost email lessons from production use.

**The one-shot rule:**
`email_segment` only fires on the FIRST time a post is published. If you publish without it and then try to add it — Ghost won't send. You must use Ghost admin to manually trigger a resend, and even then it's unreliable. Always include `email_segment` in the same call that sets `status: "published"`.

**Email-safe content:**
Ghost sends HTML email through its own template wrapper. What gets stripped:
- All `<script>` tags
- `position: fixed` and `position: sticky`
- Subscribe portal widgets (`##subscribe##`)
- Custom fonts loaded via `@font-face`
- External CSS files

What works in email:
- Inline styles
- Standard HTML (p, h2, h3, ul, ol, blockquote, hr, img)
- YouTube embeds (renders as linked thumbnail in most clients)
- Web fonts from Google Fonts loaded inline

**Subscriber segments:**
- `"email_segment": "all"` — free + paid subscribers
- `"email_segment": "free"` — free tier only
- `"email_segment": "paid"` — paid subscribers only
- Omit `email_segment` entirely — no email sent (web publish only)

**Member-only content:**
Set `"visibility": "members"` on a post to restrict it to logged-in members. `"visibility": "paid"` restricts to paying subscribers. Default is `"public"`.

**Scheduling for time zones:**
Ghost stores and sends in UTC. If your audience is US-based and you want delivery at 9AM Eastern, set `published_at` to `T14:00:00.000Z` (EST) or `T13:00:00.000Z` (EDT).

**Subject line:**
Ghost uses the post title as the email subject. Keep titles under 60 characters for mobile preview. Avoid ALL CAPS and excessive punctuation — triggers spam filters.

---

## Workflow 9: Ghost + OpenClaw Integration Patterns

How to wire Ghost into agent workflows so publishing becomes automatic.

**Cron-based publishing schedule:**
Create a cron job in OpenClaw that checks a drafts queue and publishes on a schedule:
```
# Check for scheduled posts every morning
openclaw cron add "ghost-publish-check" "0 9 * * *" "Check Ghost drafts queue and publish any posts due today"
```

In the cron prompt, instruct the agent to:
1. Fetch posts filtered by `status:scheduled` and `published_at` in today's range
2. Verify content looks correct
3. Update status to `published` with `email_segment` if newsletter delivery is intended

**Memory file for publishing cadence:**
Keep a `memory/publishing.md` file that tracks:
```markdown
## Publishing Log
- Last published: 2026-03-16 — "Post Title"
- Next scheduled: 2026-03-23
- Subscriber count: 847 (as of 2026-03-16)
- Total posts: 12
```

Update this after every publish. Use it to avoid gaps and track cadence.

**Ghost as a CMS for other content:**
Ghost pages (not posts) work well as persistent content stores — about pages, landing pages, link-in-bio pages. Create/update via API the same way as posts. Pages don't appear in the feed and don't trigger emails.

**Batch operations from a working file:**
Keep a `memory/ghost-queue.md` with pending posts in structured format:
```markdown
## Queue
- [ ] Title: "Post Title" | Tags: Essay, AI | Status: draft | Notes: needs intro
- [x] Title: "Published Post" | Published: 2026-03-10
```

Agent reads the queue, drafts or publishes each item, marks done.

---

## Workflow 10: Analytics & Insights

**What the Admin API gives you:**
```bash
# Subscriber count
GET /members/?limit=1
# → meta.pagination.total = total member count

# Active subscribers only
GET /members/?limit=1&filter=subscribed:true

# Post engagement (basic)
GET /posts/{id}/?fields=id,title,email_recipient_filter,email,published_at
# → email.opened_count, email.clicked_count (if email was sent)

# Recent posts with metadata
GET /posts/?limit=10&fields=id,title,published_at,slug,feature_image,tags
```

**What the Admin API does NOT give you:**
- Page views and unique visitors
- Traffic sources / referrers
- Post-level view counts (these are in Ghost's native analytics dashboard only)
- Conversion rates (free → paid)

Ghost's traffic analytics are dashboard-only and not exposed via any API.

**Recommended alternative:**
Use a third-party analytics tool (Plausible, Fathom, or Google Analytics) alongside Ghost. These provide real traffic data via their own APIs and are more reliable long-term. Ghost supports adding custom tracking scripts via Settings → Code injection in Ghost Admin.

**Subscriber growth tracking:**
Poll `/members/?limit=1` on a schedule and log the total to a memory file. Simple, reliable, tells you the most important metric.
```bash
# Run weekly, append to memory/ghost-analytics.md

---

## Workflow 11: Ghost Webhooks + Automation (Zapier / Make / n8n)

Ghost fires outbound webhooks on key events. Wire these to automation platforms to trigger downstream workflows automatically.

**Set up a webhook in Ghost:**
Ghost Admin → Settings → Integrations → Add custom integration → Webhooks tab → Add webhook

**Available webhook events:**
- `post.published` — fires when a post goes live
- `post.unpublished` — fires when a post is taken down
- `member.added` — new subscriber joined
- `member.deleted` — subscriber unsubscribed
- `member.edited` — subscriber updated (tier change, email change)
- `page.published` — page published

**Webhook payload (post.published example):**
```json
{
  "post": {
    "current": {
      "id": "...",
      "title": "Post Title",
      "url": "https://your-site.ghost.io/post-slug/",
      "published_at": "2026-03-16T18:00:00.000Z",
      "tags": [...],
      "feature_image": "https://..."
    }
  }
}
```

**Common automation patterns:**

**n8n — auto-post to Twitter/X when published:**
- Trigger: Webhook node (receives Ghost post.published)
- Action: Twitter node → compose tweet from title + URL
- Add delay node (5 min) to let Ghost CDN cache the post first

**Zapier — notify Slack when new subscriber joins:**
- Trigger: Webhooks by Zapier (catches member.added)
- Action: Slack message to #subscribers channel with member email

**Make — cross-post to LinkedIn:**
- Trigger: Webhooks module (post.published)
- Action: HTTP module → LinkedIn API → create post with excerpt + link

**OpenClaw cron as webhook receiver:**
You can point Ghost webhooks at your OpenClaw gateway (if externally accessible) to trigger agent actions directly on publish events.

---

## Workflow 12: SEO & Metadata Control

Ghost exposes full SEO metadata via the Admin API. Control everything programmatically.

**Fields available on posts/pages:**
```json
{
  "posts": [{
    "title": "Post Title",
    "slug": "custom-url-slug",
    "custom_excerpt": "This appears in feed cards and social previews (150 chars max)",
    "meta_title": "SEO Title (overrides post title in <title> tag)",
    "meta_description": "SEO meta description (150-160 chars, appears in search results)",
    "og_title": "Open Graph title (Facebook, LinkedIn share preview)",
    "og_description": "Open Graph description",
    "og_image": "https://url-to-og-image-1200x630.jpg",
    "twitter_title": "Twitter card title",
    "twitter_description": "Twitter card description",
    "twitter_image": "https://url-to-twitter-image.jpg",
    "canonical_url": "https://original-source-if-syndicated.com/post"
  }]
}
```

**Slug rules:**
- Ghost auto-generates slugs from titles — override with `slug` field
- Lowercase, hyphens only, no special characters
- Ghost appends `-2`, `-3` etc. on duplicates
- Changing a slug breaks existing links — set it right the first time or add redirects

**Feature image vs OG image:**
- `feature_image` — shown in the post and feed cards
- `og_image` — used for social sharing previews (defaults to feature_image if not set)
- Recommended: set both explicitly. OG image optimal size: 1200×630px

**Canonical URL:**
Use when syndicating content from another platform. Tells search engines the original source. Prevents duplicate content penalties.
```json
{ "canonical_url": "https://medium.com/original-post-url" }
```

**Batch SEO audit + fix:**
```js
// Fetch all posts missing meta descriptions
const posts = await fetch('/posts/?limit=all&filter=meta_description:null&fields=id,title,slug,custom_excerpt');
// For each: generate meta_description from custom_excerpt or title
// PUT update with meta_description filled
```

---

## Workflow 13: Multi-Site Management

Running more than one Ghost site? Structure credentials and agent workflows to handle both cleanly.

**Multi-site credentials file:**
```json
{
  "sites": {
    "primary": {
      "url": "https://site-one.ghost.io",
      "key": "id:secret"
    },
    "secondary": {
      "url": "https://site-two.ghost.io",
      "key": "id:secret"
    }
  }
}
```

Store at `~/.openclaw/credentials/ghost-sites.json`

**Token generation per site:**
```bash
node -e "
const {createHmac}=require('node:crypto');
const sites=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(process.env.HOME+'/.openclaw/credentials/ghost-sites.json','utf8'));
const site=sites.sites['primary']; // change to 'secondary' as needed
const [id,secret]=site.key.split(':');
const h=Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({alg:'HS256',typ:'JWT',kid:id})).toString('base64url');
const n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1000);
const p=Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({iat:n,exp:n+300,aud:'/admin/'})).toString('base64url');
const s=createHmac('sha256',Buffer.from(secret,'hex')).update(h+'.'+p).digest('base64url');
// output(JSON.stringify({token:h+'.'+p+'.'+s,url:site.url}));
"
```

**Cross-post the same content to multiple sites:**
```js
const sites = ['primary', 'secondary'];
for (const siteName of sites) {
  const site = config.sites[siteName];
  const token = generateToken(site.key);
  await fetch(`${site.url}/ghost/api/admin/posts/?source=html`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Ghost ${token}`, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ posts: [postData] })
  });
  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1000)); // 1s between sites
}
```

**Per-site memory tracking:**
Keep separate publishing logs per site in memory:
```markdown
## Site: Primary (site-one.ghost.io)
- Subscribers: 847
- Last published: 2026-03-16

## Site: Secondary (site-two.ghost.io)
- Subscribers: 234
- Last published: 2026-03-10
```

## Workflow 14: Site Audit — Find and Fix Content Debt

Use case: You've been publishing for a while and your archive has gaps — missing feature images, empty excerpts, orphaned tags, posts with broken internal links. This workflow pulls your full post list and produces an actionable audit report.

Run this periodically (monthly or before major site pushes). It requires no npm packages — pure Node.js built-ins.

### Step 1: Generate a JWT token

```bash
TOKEN=$(node -e "
const {createHmac}=require('node:crypto');
const creds=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(process.env.HOME+'/.openclaw/credentials/ghost-admin.json','utf8'));
const [id,secret]=creds.key.split(':');
const h=Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({alg:'HS256',typ:'JWT',kid:id})).toString('base64url');
const n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1000);
const p=Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({iat:n,exp:n+300,aud:'/admin/'})).toString('base64url');
const s=createHmac('sha256',Buffer.from(secret,'hex')).update(h+'.'+p).digest('base64url');
process.stdout.write(h+'.'+p+'.'+s);
")
URL=$(node -e "const c=JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(process.env.HOME+'/.openclaw/credentials/ghost-admin.json','utf8'));process.stdout.write(c.url);")
```

### Step 2: Fetch all published posts

```bash
node -e "
const https=require('https');
const {createHmac}=require('node:crypto');
const fs=require('fs');

const creds=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(process.env.HOME+'/.openclaw/credentials/ghost-admin.json','utf8'));
const [id,secret]=creds.key.split(':');

function makeToken(){
  const h=Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({alg:'HS256',typ:'JWT',kid:id})).toString('base64url');
  const n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1000);
  const p=Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({iat:n,exp:n+300,aud:'/admin/'})).toString('base64url');
  const s=createHmac('sha256',Buffer.from(secret,'hex')).update(h+'.'+p).digest('base64url');
  return h+'.'+p+'.'+s;
}

async function fetchPage(page){
  return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
    const url=new URL(creds.url);
    const path='/ghost/api/admin/posts/?limit=15&page='+page+'&status=published&fields=id,title,slug,published_at,updated_at,feature_image,custom_excerpt,tags,meta_description&include=tags';
    const options={hostname:url.hostname,path,method:'GET',headers:{'Authorization':'Ghost '+makeToken()}};
    const req=https.request(options,res=>{
      let data='';
      res.on('data',d=>data+=d);
      res.on('end',()=>resolve(JSON.parse(data)));
    });
    req.on('error',reject);
    req.end();
  });
}

(async()=>{
  let page=1, allPosts=[];
  while(true){
    const data=await fetchPage(page);
    if(!data.posts||data.posts.length===0) break;
    allPosts=allPosts.concat(data.posts);
    if(!data.meta?.pagination?.next) break;
    page++;
    await new Promise(r=>setTimeout(r,300));
  }

  const now=Date.now();
  const ninetyDaysAgo=now-(90*24*60*60*1000);

  const issues={
    noFeatureImage: [],
    noExcerpt: [],
    noMetaDescription: [],
    noTags: [],
    notUpdatedIn90Days: [],
    slugWarnings: [],
  };

  for(const p of allPosts){
    if(!p.feature_image) issues.noFeatureImage.push({id:p.id,title:p.title,slug:p.slug});
    if(!p.custom_excerpt) issues.noExcerpt.push({id:p.id,title:p.title,slug:p.slug});
    if(!p.meta_description) issues.noMetaDescription.push({id:p.id,title:p.title,slug:p.slug});
    if(!p.tags||p.tags.length===0) issues.noTags.push({id:p.id,title:p.title,slug:p.slug});
    if(new Date(p.updated_at).getTime()<ninetyDaysAgo) issues.notUpdatedIn90Days.push({id:p.id,title:p.title,slug:p.slug,updated_at:p.updated_at});
    // Slug warnings: numeric-only, very short, or contains underscores
    if(/^\d+$/.test(p.slug)||p.slug.length<4||p.slug.includes('_'))
      issues.slugWarnings.push({id:p.id,title:p.title,slug:p.slug});

### What the audit checks

| Check | What it flags | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Missing feature image | Posts with no `feature_image` | Feature images are required for social sharing previews and feed cards. Posts without them look broken on Twitter/LinkedIn shares. |
| Missing excerpt | Posts with no `custom_excerpt` | Excerpts drive Ghost's client-side search and appear in feed cards. Missing excerpts = invisible in search, weak social previews. |
| Missing meta description | Posts with no `meta_description` | Google uses this in search results. Empty = Google writes its own, usually badly. |
| No tags | Posts with zero tags | Tags are Ghost's primary navigation and filtering mechanism. Untagged posts are orphaned — readers can't find them via tag pages. |
| Not updated in 90+ days | Posts with a stale `updated_at` | Useful for identifying candidates for a content refresh pass. Not always an issue — but flags the oldest untouched content. |
| Slug warnings | Very short slugs, numeric-only, underscores | Short or auto-generated slugs hurt SEO. Numeric-only (`/123/`) are meaningless to search engines. Underscores break URL parsing in some clients. |

### Step 3: Fix issues via batch update

After reviewing the audit output, use Workflow 3 (Batch Update) to fix the flagged posts. Priority order:

1. **Missing feature images** — highest impact on social sharing and feed aesthetics
2. **Missing excerpts** — fixes search visibility immediately
3. **Missing meta descriptions** — SEO fix, worth doing in bulk
4. **No tags** — assign at least one primary tag per post
5. **Slug warnings** — fix carefully; changing slugs breaks existing links (add redirects first via Ghost Admin → Labs)

### Pitfalls

- The audit script regenerates a JWT before each paginated page fetch — tokens expire in 5 minutes and large sites (100+ posts) take time to fetch.
- `not updated in 90 days` does NOT mean the content is bad — a timeless essay published two years ago that still ranks well doesn't need touching. Use judgment.
- Slug fixes require adding a redirect in Ghost Admin → Settings → Labs → Redirects (upload a JSON file) before changing the slug, or you'll create dead links.

## Workflow 15: Content Performance Intelligence

Use case: You've been publishing for months. You want to know what's actually working — which posts drive email engagement, which content never reached your subscribers, and where your pages have health gaps.

Ghost's Admin API exposes email engagement data (opens, clicks) per post, member counts by tier, post and page metadata. This workflow assembles all of it into a three-section report.

**What this covers:**
- Audience snapshot: active subscribers, free vs paid split
- Section 1 — Email performance: open rate, click rate, CTO, divergence analysis
- Section 2 — Web-only posts: content published but never emailed (amplification candidates + health snapshot)
- Section 3 — Pages: evergreen content health (AI consultant, about, landing pages etc.)

**What Ghost's API cannot give you** (the ceiling):
- Per-post or per-page view counts — dashboard-only, backed by Tinybird, no API access
- Traffic sources / referrers — not exposed
- Free → paid conversion per post — not exposed
- Time-on-page — not exposed

For per-post view counts, wire a third-party analytics tool alongside Ghost:
- **Plausible** (`plausible.io/api/v1/stats/breakdown?property=event:page`) — simple, privacy-first, clean REST API
- **Fathom** (`usefathom.com/api`) — similar to Plausible
- **GA4** (`analyticsdata.googleapis.com`) — more complex OAuth but most widely used

All three return per-URL view counts you can join to Ghost post slugs.

### Reading the report

**Open rate benchmarks:**
| Rate | Signal |
|---|---|
| Under 20% | Below average — subject line or sender reputation issue |
| 20–40% | Solid — typical for engaged lists |
| 40–60% | Strong — highly engaged audience |
| 60%+ | Exceptional — or MPP inflation (see pitfalls) |

**Click rate benchmarks:**
| Rate | Signal |
|---|---|
| Under 1% | Low — CTA buried or missing |
| 1–3% | Average |
| 3–5% | Strong |
| 5%+ | Exceptional |

**Click-to-open (CTO)** — the most honest signal. Of everyone who opened, how many clicked? High CTO means the content delivered on the subject line's promise. Low CTO means a curiosity open, not a real read.

**High open / low click (divergent posts):** Hidden wins. The subject line worked — people opened. But nothing inside drove a click. Add a CTA, a relevant link, or a "continue reading" anchor. A small edit can unlock latent engagement from an already-warm audience.

**Web-only posts:** Invisible to your subscriber list. Ghost doesn't allow retroactive API email sends — duplicate the post and publish fresh, or use Ghost Admin to manually resend if that option is available.

**Pages:** Evergreen content (about, landing pages, tools). Health flags catch SEO gaps — missing meta descriptions and excerpts on pages hurt search visibility just as much as on posts.

### Saving the report

```bash
node ghost-performance.js > ghost-performance-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

Run monthly. Compare rates over time to spot list fatigue, content drift, or CTA decay.

### Pitfalls

- `email.opened_count` and `email.clicked_count` only return data with `&include=email` — omitting it returns null even for emailed posts.
- **Apple Mail Privacy Protection (MPP)** pre-loads email pixels on iOS/macOS, inflating open rates. Open rates above 70% on small lists are often MPP artifacts. Click rate and CTO are more reliable signals.
- The `email_recipient_filter` field shows segment (`all`, `free`, `paid`) — compare like-for-like when benchmarking rates across posts.
- Token expires in 5 minutes — the script regenerates before every paginated fetch so long archives won't expire mid-run.
- Pages use the `/pages/` endpoint, not `/posts/` — they won't appear in post queries even though they share most fields.

## Workflow 16: Tag Management

Full tag CRUD via the Ghost Admin API. Requires an **owner-level token** for write operations — integration tokens return `403` on create/update/delete. List is readable with any token.

```python
import requests, json, subprocess

creds     = json.load(open('/Users/you/.openclaw/credentials/ghost-admin.json'))
GHOST_URL = creds['url']

def get_token():
    # Uses the Node.js ghost-token.js script from references/api.md
    return subprocess.check_output(['node', 'scripts/ghost-token.js']).decode().strip()

headers = {'Authorization': f'Ghost {get_token()}', 'Accept-Version': 'v5.0'}

def safe_check(r, action):
    if r.status_code == 403:
        print(f"[tag-mgmt] {action} requires owner-level token — manage tags manually in Ghost Admin or use an owner token.")
        return False
    return True

# List all tags
tags = requests.get(f'{GHOST_URL}/ghost/api/admin/tags/?limit=all', headers=headers).json().get('tags', [])
for t in tags:
    print(t['id'], t['name'], t['slug'])

# Create a tag
r = requests.post(f'{GHOST_URL}/ghost/api/admin/tags/', headers=headers,
    json={"tags": [{"name": "Your Tag", "slug": "your-tag"}]})
if safe_check(r, "Create"):
    print(r.json()['tags'][0]['id'])

# Update a tag
TAG_ID = "tag-id-from-list"
r = requests.put(f'{GHOST_URL}/ghost/api/admin/tags/{TAG_ID}/', headers=headers,
    json={"tags": [{"id": TAG_ID, "name": "Updated Name", "slug": "updated-slug"}]})
safe_check(r, "Update")

# Delete a tag
r = requests.delete(f'{GHOST_URL}/ghost/api/admin/tags/{TAG_ID}/', headers=headers)
if safe_check(r, "Delete") and r.status_code == 204:
    print("Deleted.")

# Bulk assign a tag to all posts missing it
posts = requests.get(f'{GHOST_URL}/ghost/api/admin/posts/?limit=all&include=tags', headers=headers).json()['posts']
for post in posts:
    existing = [{"id": t["id"]} for t in post.get("tags", [])]
    if not any(t["id"] == TAG_ID for t in existing):
        existing.append({"id": TAG_ID})
        requests.put(
            f'{GHOST_URL}/ghost/api/admin/posts/{post["id"]}/',
            headers=headers,
            json={"posts": [{"id": post["id"], "updated_at": post["updated_at"], "tags": existing}]}
        )
        print(f"Tagged: {post['title']}")
```

### Pitfalls
- `GET /tags/` works with integration tokens. All write operations require owner-level credentials.
- Tag slugs must be unique — `POST` returns `422` if a slug already exists.
- Deleting a tag removes it from all posts — it does not delete the posts.
