## Installation

### Option 1: ClawHub (recommended for OpenClaw users)

```bash
npx clawhub install Amazon-analysis-skill
```

This installs the skill into `./skills/Amazon-analysis-skill/` under your current directory.

**For OpenClaw:** Run this command in your OpenClaw workspace directory (usually `~/.openclaw/workspace`). The skill will be automatically loaded in your next session — no extra setup needed.

**For other AI agents (Claude Code, etc.):** After install, point your agent to the `SKILL.md` file in the installed directory.

### Option 2: Manual Install

Clone this repo or download the files directly into your agent's skill directory.

## Setup

1. Get an API Key at [apiclaw.io/api-keys](https://apiclaw.io/api-keys) (format: `hms_live_xxx`)
2. Tell your AI agent your API Key — it handles the rest automatically.
