## Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Next |
|--------|---------|------|
| `pending` | Ready to dispatch (dependencies met) | → running |
| `blocked` | Waiting on depends_on tasks | → pending (auto) |
| `running` | Agent is working | → reviewing / failed |
| `reviewing` | Cross-review in progress (full review only) | → done / running (fix) |
| `done` | Complete, commit pushed | terminal |
| `failed` | Max retries exhausted | → escalated |
| `escalated` | Sent to human | terminal |

## Review Level

Each task has a `review_level` that determines post-completion verification:

| Level | When to Use | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `full` 🔴 | Core logic, financial operations, security-critical code | Dispatch cross-review agent. Must pass (no Critical/High). Fail → return for fixes. |
| `scan` 🟡 | Integration code, data persistence, moderate complexity | Orchestrator checks `git diff --stat` + reads key functions. Obvious issues → return. Otherwise → done. |
| `skip` 🟢 | UI pages, scripts, CLI tools, low-risk CRUD | Mark done immediately after commit verification. |

### Assignment Guidelines

**`full` — money/security/core logic:**
- Anything that signs transactions or handles credentials
- Order execution and lifecycle management
- Strategy signals (entry/exit/stop-loss/take-profit)
- Risk management / guardrails
- Real trading integration points

**`scan` — integration/persistence:**
- Data provider integrations (WS clients, REST wrappers)
- Database CRUD for non-financial tables
- State recovery / reconciliation
- Account configuration management

**`skip` — UI/scripts/utilities:**
- Frontend pages and components
- Verification/test scripts
- CLI tools
- Data layer queries and API routes for read-only display

### Completion Flow by Level

```
full:  Agent done → verify scope → dispatch review agent → pass → done
scan:  Agent done → verify scope → orchestrator reads diff → ok → done
skip:  Agent done → verify scope → done
```

## Auto-unblock Rule

When a task reaches `done`, scan all `blocked` tasks. If all their `depends_on` tasks are `done`, flip to `pending`.
